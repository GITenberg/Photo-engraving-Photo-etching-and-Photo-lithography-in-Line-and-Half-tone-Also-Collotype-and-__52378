</div>

<p>The many kind letters I have received from America with regard to what
must be called my first crude effort at bookmaking, prompted the idea—after
issuing a second and revised edition in England—of making an attempt to
cater for the inhabitants of Greater Britain, which, under the able editorship of
<span class="smcap">M<span>R.</span></span>
<span class="smcap">E<span>DWARD</span></span>
L. <span class="smcap">W<span>ILSON</span></span> will,
I have no doubt, meet with approbation and
be useful. I have made many important additions to the last English edition.</p>

<p class="fsize6">
<span class="smcap">L<span>EICESTER,</span></span> <span class="smcap">E<span>NGLAND.</span></span></p>

<p class="padtopa">Besides revising the English edition and incorporating in proper place such
additions as I have found useful in practice, I have boiled down the best
points from current publications in France and Germany, and added them.</p>

<p>More still, with high regard for the author, I add chapters and parts from,
the <i>Handbuch der Chemigraphie und Photochemigraphie</i>, by Mr. J. O. Mörch.
Thus, I believe, this work is made complete to date. All the rest must come
to the worker, from industrious, careful practice.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<p>Very rapid progress has been made in photo-reproductive processes during
the past two years, and improvements are announced almost weekly. I invite
all interested to keep me informed of what they discover. If I am supplied
with the proper addresses I shall publish and distribute what I learn.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" title="Introduction." id="p-xv">
INTRODUCTION.</h2></div>

<p>The improvements made within the last twenty years in the art of printing
books have not, until recently, been kept pace with by the methods of illustration.
Wood engraving, except for high class and expensive editions, was crude,
whilst the use of engravings from copper or steel, or of lithographs, was also
restricted to short and expensive editions.</p>

<p>The introduction of the zinc-etching process, in which the picture is first
drawn in line, or stipple, or chalk, upon lithographic transfer paper, then
transferred to a plate of zinc and subjected to a process of etching in various
baths of acid water, marks a new era, replete with great improvements in
cheapness, facility of production, and artistic results.</p>

<p>This new process had scarcely been in good working order before it was
seen that great improvements might be made by enlisting photography in its
service; because in its original form it was necessary that the design be made
of the same size as the finished block, which, in many cases, added too much
to the expense. But by introducing photography, the size of the original was
of no moment; the lens could easily reduce that, and at the same time preserve
the proportions, as well as fine down any crudity in the drawing.</p>

<p>The first methods of producing a photo-transfer, were by making a negative
from the original, then paper coated with bichromated gelatine was exposed
under this negative, and the sensitive gelatine, corresponding with the transparent
portions of the negative (representing the lines of the original), being
exposed to the action of light was made non-absorbent of water, whilst the
sensitive gelatine representing the white portion of the original being protected
from the action of light by the dark portion of the negative, still retained its
affinity for water. The consequence was that when a roller charged with fatty
ink was applied to the wet print, the exposed portions of the gelatine took the
ink, but the white portion being charged with water rejected it, the result being
a replica of the original in a fatty ink. This was used as an ordinary lithographic
transfer and could be transferred to zinc and etched in relief.
<span class="xxpn" id="p-xvi">{xvi}</span></p>

<p>Such a process was not perfect, and was not suitable for subjects which
necessarily should be to scale. So the next improvement was to place a plain
mirror between the lens and sensitive plate, so producing a negative in its
proper position as regards right and left; then from this reversed negative a
print in fatty ink could be made direct on the zinc.</p>

<p>These transfers on paper, or direct prints on the zinc, are restricted entirely
to what are generally termed “subjects in line,” such as architectural drawings,
plans, woodcuts, engravings from steel or copper plates, or lithographs in
pure line, in chalk, or in stipple. The attainment of effect of half tones by
graduated works of color, thinner or thicker, or the smooth, delicate gradations
of a photograph, are not permissible in relief blocks of this kind, although for
short numbers this class of subject could be utilized by employing the collotype,
heliotype, or lichtdruck methods, which render the half-tones without
(visible) breaking up of the gradations.</p>

<p>The next step was to perfect the various (published first in 1854 by Fox
Talbot) methods of mechanically breaking up the half-tones of a photograph,
and so giving a means whereby a photograph in all its delicacy may be used
to illustrate a letter-press article.</p>

<p>Of course, during the progress of rendering photography applicable for
relief blocks, its usefulness for intaglio printing was not neglected. And now
having entered into very close competition with wood engraving and by modification
of the collotype methods, with lithography, photography can now be
used for the production of intaglio plates, in half-tones as well as in line.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<p>The methods by which the above results are attained furnish the text of
the pages to follow; and as each and every method given has been tried by the
author, the reader may be satisfied that the manual is, as claimed,

Appliances For Making Photographic Negatives.">CHAPTER I.
<span class="blksmaller">
APPLIANCES FOR MAKING PHOTOGRAPHIC NEGATIVES.</span></h3>

<p>For all methods of heliographic printing a suitable photographic negative
is absolutely necessary, and to produce that negative good apparatus and pure
chemicals, used with skill and intelligence, are indispensable.</p>

<p>The studio must be well lighted, with a perfectly firm floor. The dark-room
should be kept for negative work only (the room where the zinc printing is
carried on being a separate room). There must be a roomy sink in front of a
good-sized window covered with a non-actinic medium (yellow, not orange),
such as two thicknesses of golden fabric, so as to have plenty of light to see the
progress of development by.</p>

<p>The copying camera must have a long bellows and should not be less than
12 by 10, fitted with rack-work, so as to be able to get absolute sharpness in
focussing.</p>

<p>It will be a great advantage, and aid in adjusting the position on the
focussing screen of the drawings to be copied, if a vertical line be drawn, and
another horizontally, so that they bisect each other exactly in the centre; then
<i>from the centre</i>, mark and number each inch and half inch upon each of the
four arms of the cross; it can then be seen at a glance not only that the picture
is in the centre, but also that it is about the right size.
<span class="xxpn" id="p010">{10}</span></p>

<p>The dark slide must be light-tight, and made strong rather than for
portability.</p>

<p>The lens should be rectilinear, and should be capable of covering the largest
size plate the camera will take quite sharp to the corners. For a 12 by 10
plate a lens with an equivalent focus of about 18 inches will be best.</p>

<div class="figleft imwth09" id="fig01">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" width="192" height="217" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 1.</div>
</div>

<p>To the lens must be fitted a reversing mirror of silvered glass, mounted
behind the lens by preference, as such a style of mounting not only protects
the surface of the mirror from the air, but keeps
extraneous light from affecting the brilliancy of the
image. (Fig. 1.)</p>

<p>The camera must be mounted upon a solid table
fixed upon small grooved or flanged wheels, such
wheels running either upon rails fixed upon or in
grooves cut into the floor, at right angles to the wall
against which the copying board is fitted.</p>

<p>The copying easel is placed perpendicularly in
front of, and perfectly parallel with, the camera.
As a mirror is used, the camera is sideways to the
object, not facing it, as in copying direct.</p>

<p>The easel should be so contrived that it can be raised or lowered, and moved
right and left, which double motion is managed by having the easel double;
the up and down motion should be obtained by hanging the back portion like
a window sash, the weights being exactly the weight of the whole easel, and
the pulleys over which the cords go, not running too freely.</p>

<p>At the top and bottom of the back portions of the easel are projecting strips
with a rabbet deep enough to allow the front or copying board to slide sideways,
but not loosely; this front board should be painted a dead black with
white lines in the centre from top to bottom and from side to side, said lines
being divided into inches and half inches, from the centre, so that the drawing
may be pinned in the exact centre without trouble.</p>

<p>A convenient size for a copying board is 4 feet high by 5 feet wide.</p>

<p>In connection with the camera, the only thing left to describe is the focussing
cloth, which should be quite opaque, and of ample size to exclude all extraneous
light from behind when focussing.</p>

<p>For focussing the image absolutely sharp, a magnifying glass may be
required.</p>

<p>When the salts are dissolved, filter and add to the collodion.</p>

<p>The filtering is best done by placing a pledget of cotton-wool in the neck
of a glass funnel and passing the iodizer through it. To prevent evaporation,
lay a glass plate over the funnel.</p>

<p>The iodizer being added to the collodion, shake them up thoroughly and
allow to stand for a week to settle, then decant into convenient bottles; this
collodion is ready for use in a week, but will improve with age up to six
months, after which time it should be mixed with new.</p>

<p>When coating plates with collodion, it is not a wise plan to pour the surplus
from the plate back into the bottle from which it was poured. Pour it into
another, kept handy for the purpose, the contents of which, at the end of the
day’s work, empty into the stock bottle after such a quantity as is sufficient for
next day’s consumption has been decanted into the pourer.</p>

<p>The best bottle from which to pour the collodion upon the plate is the tall
capped bottle sold by the dealers as collodion pourers.
<span class="xxpn" id="p012">{12}</span></p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="The Nitrate of Silver Bath (1).">THE NITRATE OF SILVER BATH (1).</h4>

<p>The silver bath is a most important factor in the production of good
negatives. It must be compounded with care and used with skill.</p>
</div>

<p>To make it, dissolve 6 ounces of nitrate of silver in 10 ounces of water, then
add 10 drops of collodion, and shake up well; then add 70 ounces of water,
and let it stand all night; then filter through a pledget of cotton-wool packed
loosely in the neck of a glass funnel, into a clean bottle or jug; then add 1
drachm of nitric acid and let stand all night before trying. Such bottle or jug,
and also the glass funnel, must be kept solely for use with the silver bath.</p>

<p>The bath holder may be an upright vessel of the ordinary pattern, with a
dipper with which to lower the plate into the solution; or it may be a flat dish
with a cover to keep out light and dust, using a silver hook to lift the plate
from the solution; if the former shape be chosen, let the dipper be of glass,
porcelain, silver wire, or of wood soaked in melted paraffine, but on no account
of ebonite, as such a dipper will cause spots, and derange the bath sooner or
later.</p>

<p>If a flat dish be used, the best form is of wood lined with asphaltum, hanging
on a cradle, the lower end being a well to hold the solution; in this form of
bath the plate, after sensitizing, is drained thoroughly before taking it out.
This is a great convenience, as not only is silver solution saved, but the dark
slide will last much longer.</p>

<p>The bath solution made up as above will be the right strength for work,
but as every plate sensitized therein, takes away its modicum of silver, after a
certain time it must be strengthened, as it is essential for the production of
good work that the solution be kept at a proper strength. The best way of
doing this is to add a drachm or two of saturated solution of nitrate of silver,
after each day’s work has been done, and if the solution be worked in a flat
bath, it will be as well to pour it into a jug and filter it before using again;
with an upright holder, this filtering will only require to be done about once
or twice a week, as any particles of dust, etc., subside and have not the same
chance of falling upon the film as in a flat bath; but the addition of the silver
solution should be made, and the solution well stirred up with the dipper.</p>

<p>In course of time a silver bath will become contaminated with organic matter
from various causes, and can also be supersaturated with ether and alcohol—with
iodo-bromo or nitrate of zinc, and will either refuse to work, or only
<span class="xxpn" id="p013">{13}</span>
yield imperfect films and thin images. In such cases the best plan will be to
take 20 ounces of the solution, dilute it with clean water 60 ounces, filter, and
add 6 ounces of nitrate of silver, and again filter, when a new bath will be
the result.</p>

<p>The silver in the rejected portion of the old bath should be precipitated as a
chloride, by the addition of a solution of common salt, the precipitate dried and
sent to a refiner, together with the ashes of the filtering papers and blotting-paper
used to drain the plates upon, or to wipe the backs of the plates after
leaving the bath and before putting them into the dark slide.</p>

<p>The silver solution named above, is suitable for negatives of subjects in line,
but for the production of negatives with delicate half tones, such as portraits,
landscapes, or of the many subjects which are photographed direct, then it will
be necessary to provide another bath solution, made and managed in the same
way, but only containing sufficient nitric acid to just redden litmus paper, as a
bath gives the finest half-tones when nearly neutral, or only slightly acid. It
should be remembered that the deepest shadows are represented by clear glass
in the negative, to insure which would be impossible with the silver solution
inclining ever so slightly toward alkalinity.</p>

<p>The nitrate of silver bath may be made up with distilled water, if pure—that
is, if the water is bona fide distilled and not merely from waste steam; if
this cannot be guaranteed, the best plan will be to get a gallon of tap water,
dissolve in it one ounce of nitrate of silver, then add saturated solution of
bicarbonate of soda, until an alkaline reaction to litmus paper takes place, then
place the lot in white glass bottles, and expose to the action of light for three
or four days. During that time the solution will, first of all, turn black, and
then will gradually become quite clear, the organic matter—which if not
removed, would have caused trouble—falling in a black mass to the bottom.</p>

<p>Now filter the purified water and use it for compounding the nitrate of silver
bath, but do not use it for any other purpose.</p>

<p>The strength of a nitrate of silver bath, for line work, should be thirty
grains of nitrate of silver to each ounce of water, and should not be allowed
to fall below twenty-five; and for half-tone negatives, nitrate of silver should
be thirty-five, and not lower than thirty grains to the ounce.</p>

<p>Be sure to keep all funnels, bottles, and dishes used for the silver bath,
separate and distinct from all others, and never use them for any other
purpose. <span class="xxpn" id="p014">{14}</span></p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="The Nitrate of Silver Bath (2).">THE NITRATE OF SILVER BATH (2).</h4>

<p>In the ancient days of photography, when, to say it was possible to prepare
a dry plate nearly as sensitive as a wet collodion plate, was to excite the risible
faculties of the audience, the above heading might almost always be seen in
the journals, and the amount of matter written under that heading would fill
many good-sized volumes. Some writers went into the subject in a very
elaborate manner, whilst others would counsel very simple methods of preparation
and management.</p></div>

<p>The directions given above for making a bath solution for line negatives,
will, if carried out carefully and cleanly, at once yield a solution giving
good negatives. After the bath has been mixed, either with distilled water,
ordinary tap water (<i>in iron districts tap water should not be used</i>), or water that
has been sunned and filtered, as soon as the bulk has been made up to the
eighty ounces, the solution should be put away all night before it is tried, then
in the morning filter it carefully through a pledget of cotton-wool stuffed
loosely in the neck of a perfectly clean funnel, into a perfectly clean bottle or
jug, which must be kept entirely for use of the silver solution. When the
bath solution has been filtered it should be <i>perfectly clear</i>; if it is at all cloudy
or turbid, the filtration must be repeated.</p>

<p>When the solution is perfectly clear and bright, pour sufficient into a perfectly
clean porcelain, glass, or papier-maché dish, then take a clean plate
(polished, or albumenized) and coat it with collodion; close the door of the dark-room,
and when the film of collodion is perfectly set, raise one end of the dish
containing the silver solution, place one edge of the collodionized plate against
the bottom of the upper edge of the dish, then drop the plate upon the bottom
of the dish, and at the same time lower the dish; by this means the silver
solution will flow in an even wave over the surface of the collodionized plate;
now place the cover on the dish so as to exclude light and dust, and allow the
plate to remain in the solution for five minutes, then with a silver hook lift
the plate from the solution, and allow it to drain (remember that no light must
get into the dark-room except what is filtered through either two thicknesses
of golden fabric, or one of canary medium); when the plate has drained so that
no solution drips from it, place it into the carrier of the dark slide; then
close the dark slide and let it remain there for five minutes, at the end of
which time remove the plate to the sink, and flood it with sufficient developer
(page <a href="#p017" title="go to p. 17">17</a>) to just cover the film; keep this solution flowing, to and
fro, over the <span class="xxpn" id="p015">{15}</span>
plate for the space of two minutes, then wash it under the tap until the surface
is no longer greasy; then apply the fixing or clearing solution (page
<a href="#p017" title="go to p. 17">17</a>) until
the whole of the yellow bromo-iodide is dissolved away; again wash, and take
the plate into the daylight.</p>

<p>Now comes the test; if the film is perfectly transparent, and clear as the
glass itself, the bath is all right; but if there is the slightest deposit (which can
be removed by lightly rubbing the finger along the surface of the film), then
the solution will require the addition of a little nitric acid. After this stir it
well, and after a rest of an hour or two try again, repeat the addition of the
nitric acid, and try a plate; repeat until the film, after developing, washing,
and fixing, is perfectly clear, and free from deposit and fog.</p>

<p>The bath is now in proper working order, and if reinforced after each day’s
work with a sufficient quantity of saturated solution of nitrate of silver
(filtered), kept free from contamination with other chemicals, and carefully
filtered occasionally, it will remain in good working order for at least six
months, and then may be renewed by treating as directed on page
<a href="#p012" title="go to p. 12">12.</a></p>

<p>It will sometimes happen, notwithstanding that extreme care and cleanliness
is exercised in the management of the bath, that it will not work properly, and
the reason why cannot easily be discovered. In such a case, steps must be taken
to put the solution into working order.</p>

<p>In the case of rectifying a disordered bath, there are many methods of procedure,
but the simplest, and, as a rule, the most certain method, is to render
the solution alkaline by the addition of liquor ammonia, adding the ammonia
a little at a time; then, after well shaking, test it with red litmus paper and
continue the addition of ammonia until the red litmus paper is turned blue.
In this alkaline condition the solution should be poured into a large flat dish,
and exposed to the action of the sun. That will speedily reduce and throw
down in the form of a black precipitate, any organic matter that may be in the
bath, and at the same time the heat of the sun will cause evaporation of the
ether and alcohol left in the solution by the collodion plates.</p>

<p>The bath solution should be exposed to the sun for two or three days, or
until such time as suffices to render the solution clear, and the precipitate entirely
separated out. But this cannot take place unless the solution is decidedly
alkaline, the presence of acid stopping the action of light.</p>

<p>Do not be in a hurry about doctoring a bath solution (in fact, it will be far
best to have two solutions, one in use and one either resting or being doctored),
but give the light plenty of time to reduce the organic matter, and also to <span class="xxpn" id="p016">{16}</span>
volatilize the ether and alcohol; then filter the solution through filtering paper
(don’t use blotting-paper), as if it is attempted to filter through a pledget of
cotton-wool the fine precipitate of organic matter quickly clogs the wool and
stops the filtering.</p>

<p>The doctored solution being filtered, test it with a piece of perfectly fresh,
blue litmus paper, and add nitric acid, drop by drop—shaking well between
the additions of acid—until the blue litmus paper just turns red. Do not add
acid sufficient to make the litmus turn violently red, unless the bath is for line
negatives, as a bath for half-tone negatives must be only just acid, whereas a
bath for line work must contain more acid.</p>

<p>If the color of the litmus paper shows that the alkali has been neutralized,
a plate is collodionized, then immersed in the bath for five minutes, then
drained, and placed in the dark slide, or in a dark box for five minutes, then
flooded with the iron developer (page
<a href="#p017" title="go to p. 17">17</a>); if, upon the application of this the
film should turn black, add more nitric acid, stir up thoroughly, then try
again, repeating the trials until, upon fixing the plate with the solution of
cyanide of potassium, the film of collodion is left upon the glass plate as clear
as it was before it was immersed in the silver bath.</p>

<p>A little above here it is stated that less nitric acid is required in the bath
for half-tone negatives than for line work, and the question may well be asked
where may the line be drawn? The reply is that, for half-tone work, a piece
of blue litmus paper should, upon immersion into the solution, turn red very
slowly, but when the bath is required for line negatives the blue litmus may
at once indicate the presence of acid.</p>

<p>After a bath solution has been renovated in the above manner, it should be
tested for strength, either by the volumetric method (by preference), or by
means of the ordinary argentometer sold by the dealers, and, if, after testing,
the strength is shown to be too great, dilute with a sufficiency of sunned water
(page <a href="#p013" title="go to p. 13">13</a>); and if not sufficiently strong, add crystals of nitrate of silver to
make up the strength to thirty or thirty-five grains per ounce.</p>

<p>A bath solution renovated as above, will generally be found to work cleaner,
and yield brighter negatives than a new solution, and it will also, if carefully
used, last longer; but it must be kept up to a proper working strength by the
occasional addition of a little of a saturated solution of nitrate of silver.</p>

<p>The fact that the strength of the silver solution has got too low is shown by
the presence of semi-opaque, fantastic markings near the thick edge of the
collodion film, and also in conjunction with the presence of organic matter in <span class="xxpn" id="p017">{17}</span>
the deposition under the surface of the film of an extremely fine sand-like
deposit, which, in the fixed negative, develops into myriads of pinholes in
the densest portions of the image.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="The Developing Solution.">THE DEVELOPING SOLUTION.</h4>

<p>First purchase seven pounds of commercial sulphate of iron (copperas) and
put this into a gallon jug, and fill it up with boiling water (clean); stir with
a clean rod at short intervals for three or four hours, then allow to stand until
the sediment settles, and the top portion of the solution is clear and bright;
then decant as much as possible into a bottle or bottles, and label “Saturated
Solution of Iron.” Then again fill up the jar with boiling water, stir until as
much as possible is dissolved, so as to be ready by the time the stock in the
bottle is exhausted, and repeat the process until all the crystals are dissolved;
then wash out the jar, reject the residue, and begin again.</p></div>

<p>But bear in mind that, unless there are crystals left in the solution after each
addition of hot water, it will not be saturated; therefore, before taking the
solution into use, be sure there are undissolved crystals in the jar.</p>

<p>For use, take of</p>

<p>In the above solution, the alcohol is added to enable the developer to readily
assimilate with the sensitive film, and the quantity requisite varies with the
age of the silver bath, or, to be more correct, with the quantity of plates sensitized
therein. At first, little or no alcohol will be required, but after a number
of plates have been sensitized the developer refuses to flow evenly, and seems
disposed to run over the edges of the plate; this is a sign that more alcohol is
required, and when more has been added the developer will flow evenly as
before; but when 80 ounces of developer require over 4 ounces of alcohol to
make it flow, it is a pretty sure sign that the bath wants remaking.</p>

<p>The developer is applied to the plate after exposure, from a straight-lipped
cup, or glass measure, which should be kept for the exclusive use of this solution,
as the mixture of any of the other solutions with it will at once counteract
its working power. <span class="xxpn" id="p018">{18}</span></p>

strengthened by the addition in the evening of a lump or two of cyanide and
then stirred up with the dipper in the morning; the negative must not be left

be removed and well washed directly all the yellow iodide has been dissolved.</p>

<p>This method of intensifying is cheaper than the other, and if the washes of
acid between and after the other two solutions are carefully done, and the
stench of the sulphide is not objected to, then there is little or no difference in
the results; but if the acid washes are omitted or (and) the sulphide has not
been kept corked, and is consequently not fresh, then there is great danger of a
brown stain upon the lines, which is more or less fatal to getting a good print
on zinc.</p>

<p>For half-tone negatives, instead of fixing or clearing with the cyanide of
potassium, the developer is washed off directly, and then they are intensified at
once by the application of a mixture of pyrogallic acid, citric acid, and nitrate
of silver, as follows:</p>

<p class="pcontinue">is added. Then the mixture is poured over the film, and rocked to and fro for a
short time; the intensifier is then returned to the cup, the negative held up to
the light, and examined, and if not intense enough, the intensifier is again
applied. Great care is requisite at this stage,
as if the process be carried on too <span class="xxpn" id="p020">{20}</span>
far the negative will be too intense, and will either be spoiled, or take an
abnormal time to print; practice and observation are the only guides to
success. The grand rules for half-tone negatives are, collodion free from dust,
the glass plate clean, the bath at its full strength and in good working order,
proper time allowed the plate in the sensitizing bath, well drained, afterward a
good exposure, develop until all details are out, then wash thoroughly, intensify
with judgment, wash well, fix, and again well wash, and then, but never till
then, open the dark-room door and examine your new negative by daylight.</p>

<p>In making the collodion, soak the celloidin in the ether for about twelve
hours before adding the alcohol; be sure the ether is at least 0.725 specific
gravity, and that the alcohol is very clean, and free from gum. After
mixing the collodion and iodizer, shake up well, but do not do this before
decanting. Always decant sufficient for next day’s use, into the bottle used for
pouring, over night, so that it gets a chance to settle, and allows the air-bubbles
to escape.</p>

<p>Keep the collodion in as cool a place as possible, and in decanting it be very
careful to do it away from fire, or lighted gas or paraffine, especially where
flame is below the bottle, as ether vapor does not rise, but falls.</p>

<p>In hot weather and during long exposures, wet plates are very prone to have
a peculiar stain upon them, called oyster-shell markings, the remedies for
which are careful draining before putting them into the slide, and covering the
bottom of the carrier with clean filtering paper, so that the silver solution,
on draining down, is absorbed by the bibulous paper instead of going back up
the plate by capillary attraction.</p>

<p>In hot weather the back of the plate, when put into the dark slide, should
be covered with a wet piece of red blotting paper, or orange calico, <i>but not
white</i>; a wet cloth laid in the camera will also tend to keep the plate moist.
These precautions, however, are not required unless the exposure is likely to
exceed a quarter of an hour.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Protecting The Collodion Film.">PROTECTING THE COLLODION FILM.</h4>

<p>A collodion film, when dry, is very delicate, and, except for line work in
the hands of an expert, will require protecting. This is usually done by
slightly warming it (when quite dry) in front of a fire, and then pouring over
a sufficient quantity of thin spirit varnish. After the superfluous varnish is
well drained off, dry by again holding it in front
of the fire. The spirit <span class="xxpn" id="p021">{21}</span>
varnish answers perfectly for ordinary work, but for printing upon metal for
relief blocks, or upon glass for collotypes, it will be best to use a benzole
varnish, such as is sold by dealers for protecting the films of glass positives or
ferrotype pictures. Anthony’s “diamond” varnish is good.</p></div>

<p>But the best plan of all is to use a water varnish, made by dissolving half
an ounce of borax in a quart of boiling water, then adding a few pieces at a
time (stirring meanwhile), one pound of ordinary shellac; if the quantity of
borax named does not suffice to make all the shellac dissolve, add more, a grain
at a time, until the shellac is dissolved; then add half an ounce of white
sugar, cool and filter it.</p>

<p>When the negative is washed for the last time, allow it to drain, then flood
with the above solution, and let it dry. This will be found a quicker, cleaner,
and more satisfactory method of protecting the delicate film than with the
spirit varnish.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="The Glass Plate.">THE GLASS PLATE.</h4>

<p><i>The glass</i> used as a support for the collodion film should be thin flatted
crown of the best quality, for the negatives, as a rule, are not required again
after once the zinc is etched, so that the film may be washed off, and the glass
used again, which cannot be done so often if the glass be of bad quality; flatness
is a <i>sine qua non</i>, as it has to be subjected to heavy pressure between a
zinc plate and the front glass of a printing frame.</p></div>

<p>As a good and suitable negative is the foundation of success in the subsequent
processes, so is a properly cleaned glass plate the foundation of a
successful negative; unless the glass is chemically clean, the collodion film will
either be stained or marked, or it will split off in drying, therefore care and
attention are requisite; even in preparing a piece of glass for the reception of
the film of collodion care is especially requisite, as the want of it cannot be
seen until after all the operations, therefore the labor and time are not thrown
away.</p>

<p>There are two methods of cleaning the glass plate: one quite mechanical;
the other is a mixture of the mechanical and the chemical. Both are good.
The second is perhaps the best, as it is simple and more certain.</p>

<p>In the first method the glass, when new, merely requires polishing with clean
wash leather kept for this purpose.</p>

<p>The best way of doing this is on a flat board 24 by 18
inches, or thereabouts, <span class="xxpn" id="p022">{22}</span>
covered with good American oil-cloth, glazed side out. A plate laid upon this
will not slip about when being polished.</p>

<p>Both sides and edges of the plate must be well cleaned, as one of the most
prolific causes of derangement of the silver bath is from organic matter introduced
by imperfectly cleaned glass plates.</p>

<p>One side of the plate, if gently rubbed with the thumb nail, will be found
smoother than the other, and is the suitable side for the support of the
collodion film; this side is polished with the leather until, upon breathing
gently upon it, the film of moisture is quite free from marks or streaks, not
only in the centre but at the sides and corners.</p>

<p>It is absolutely necessary that the plate be chemically clean all over, else the
film of collodion, upon drying, will split, and the negative be spoilt.</p>

<p>When the plate is clean, an edging of India-rubber dissolved in benzole,
about an eighth of an inch wide, is run all round the edge, by means of a small
camel’s-hair brush tied to a stick, the end of the stick being level with the point
of the brush. The stick acts as a guard against the brush going too far from
the edge.</p>

<p>In the second method, the new glass plate is soaked an hour or two in a
mixture of 5 ounces of common spirits of salt (hydrochloric acid) in 80
ounces of water. After both sides of the plate are rubbed with a rag, and well
washed under the tap, it is put in a dish of clean water. When all the plates
have been so treated, they are taken out singly, again well rubbed on both
sides with another rag, and well washed; then the smoothest side having been
selected, it is twice flooded with a mixture of albumen and water, draining the
surplus into the sink each time of flooding. The plate is then placed upon a
rack to drain and dry; the drying should be effected in a current of hot air
freed from all dust.</p>

<p>The albumen mixture is composed of the white of one egg well beaten, then
diluted with 40 ounces of water and ten drops of liquor ammonia added, and
again beaten. It must then be very carefully filtered through cotton-wool, and
used as above.</p>

<p>In placing the albumenized plates upon the drying rack, care must be
taken to face the coated sides all one way, as when dry there is nothing to indicate
to the eye which is the back and which the front.</p>

<p>The albumenized plates, when dry, should have the backs cleaned with a
cloth or a leather before using, so as to clear away any albumen which may
have adhered during coating. <span class="xxpn" id="p023">{23}</span></p>

<p>Albumenized plates stored in a dry place will keep good for months, <i>and do
not require any edging with India-rubber</i>, as the most horny collodion film will
not split off an albumenized plate.</p>

<p>Glass plates that have been used, and not varnished, are freed from the films
by being immersed in a mixture of hydrochloric acid and water for a few
hours, then washed under the tap, well rubbed with a rag, and put into clean
water, from which they are taken singly and coated with albumen; or they
may be allowed to dry, and are then polished by means of the wash leather.</p>

<p>Negatives that have been varnished are cleaned by first immersing in a hot
solution of common washing soda until the film comes off, then wash them
under the tap, rubbing well with a rag, then immerse them in the acid solution
so as to neutralize the alkali. Finally they may be treated as above.</p>

<p>The films that are removed from the glass plates must not be thrown away,
but should be carefully collected, dried, and sent to a refiner with the other
silver waste; a good plan for saving these films, and at the same time keeping
the acid and soda solutions clear of them, is to filter each solution occasionally
through an old felt hat suspended conveniently over the tanks, using one for
each of the tanks.</p>

<p>The polishing of the glass plate must not be done in the dark-room, or the
crop of comets, spots, etc., upon the negatives will be exasperating in the
extreme; let this operation be conducted in a clean, quiet corner of the studio,
where no other operation will disturb, and where the fluff from dusters and
leathers will not interfere with anything else.</p>

</div>

<p>The chemicals being prepared, they must be placed in the dark-room; the
collodion bottle should be placed on a convenient shelf close to the door, and on
a handy peg hang a broad camel’s-or badger-hair brush, for dusting the clean
plate just previous to coating it with collodion; the brush must not be used for
anything else upon any pretence whatever. The silver bath must be kept,
both in use and out of use, in some convenient corner, where there is no risk
of getting any other chemical splashed into it. For a bath holder a deep 15
by 12 porcelain or papier maché dish, with a wooden or stout cardboard lid,
should be provided, and this dish must always be thoroughly washed, and
wiped dry with a clean damp leather (kept for the purpose), both before use
and after pouring the silver solution back into its bottle or jug. Or, if the
upright form be preferred, be sure and have it large enough.</p>

<p>The developer should be placed on a shelf, on the right of the sink, the
developing cup close by.</p>

<p>The fixing or clearing solution should be kept in an upright bath of glass,
porcelain, or ebonite.</p>

<p>The intensifier No. 1 may be kept in a flat dish, or in an upright holder,
at discretion; but if in a flat dish, the solution should be poured back into
its bottle, after each day’s work.</p>

<p>Keep the intensifier No. 2 in a stoppered bottle close to the sink.</p>

<p>The water varnish also is kept in a bottle or jug.</p>

<p>On a shelf close to the collodion, the polished or albumenized plates may be
stacked, with the clean or prepared side facing the wall.</p>

<p>A pneumatic holder for attaching to the back of the plate during the operation
of coating with collodion will be found very handy.</p>

<p>Of course, it is thoroughly understood that there is a sink in the dark-room,
and a good water supply is indispensable.</p>

<p>Then, again, the window through which the light is
transmitted, must be <span class="xxpn" id="p025">{25}</span>
covered with a non-actinic medium, such as two thicknesses of golden fabric,
or one of canary medium; do not stint the amount of light, but have as much
as possible, so long as it is non-actinic.</p>

</div>

<p>No arbitrary plan for the dark-room
need be followed, but the novice will
find the annexed plan useful to him in
con­tri­ving for himself. It is self-ex­plan­a­tory.</p>

<p>Everything being in read­iness, we
will now pro­ceed to make a line neg­a­tive,
reserving a des­crip­tion of half-tone
work to follow.</p>

<p>To begin: wash the bath holder
thoroughly, and wipe it dry, then pour
into it sufficient silver solution to make
the depth about half an inch; dust the
inside of the cover, and put it over the
dish; now take a clean glass plate, if
it be polished, see that it is edged with
India-rubber, and if albumenized, be
sure and clean the back—and attach
it to a pneumatic holder; then with a
broad camel’s-or badger-hair brush
(kept for this purpose only) remove any
particles of dust, back and front; now
hold the plate in a horizontal position
and pour upon it, toward the right hand
corner furthest away from the body, a
little more collodion than it is judged
will be sufficient to cover it; let the collodion run to the corner, then incline
the plate to the left, and the collodion will run into the upper left-hand corner.
Now by inclining the plate toward the body the collodion will flow into the
lower left-hand corner, and thence it is guided into the funnel placed in the
bottle prepared for its reception; during the time that this surplus is draining,
the plate must be gently rocked sideways, so that the lines formed by
the collodion, in draining, are merged, leaving the film quite homogeneous.
As soon as the collodion ceases to drip, release the plate
from the pneumatic <span class="xxpn" id="p026">{26}</span>
holder, and touch the lower ridge of the collodion; if it is quite set, close the
door of the dark-room, remove the lid from the bath holder, then—holding
the plate in the left hand—with the right hand raise the end of the bath holder,
as far as is possible without risking any of the silver solution running over the
end of the dish resting on the bench; now lay the plate (with the collodion
side up) on the bottom of the dish, then drop the plate into the solution, and,
at the same time, lower the end of the dish held up by the right hand, which
will cause the silver solution to flow in one even wave over the collodionized
surface. This operation must be done with dexterity, as if the silver solution
does not flow in an even wave the film will be marked, and, in the case of a
half-tone negative, the image will be spoilt. Therefore, it is necessary to see
that the plate and dish are lowered simultaneously, so that the solution goes
over the collodion film in one steady wave. If the upright bath holder be
used, the plate is placed upon the ledge of the dipper, and lowered slowly and
steadily into the solution.</p>

<p>The plate will require an immersion of about three minutes for proper
sensitizing, and this interval—the bath being covered up to prevent the access
of white light—may be utilized to give the final adjustment to the camera, and
to see that the drawing or print to be copied is properly in focus.</p>

<p>Use a medium diaphragm in the lens for focussing, and examine the image
all over before deciding that it is sharp. Focus by preference about halfway
between the centre of the picture and the edges, and then, after moving the
rack to and fro until the proper sharpness is obtained, take out the diaphragm
and substitute the smallest sent out with the lens; or if the picture to be
taken be small and from a large original, then the second, or third, smallest
diaphragm may be used.</p>

<p>Now remove the focussing screen from the camera (note that the ground
side of the glass has been next the lens) and place the cap upon the lens;
close the door of the dark-room, open the dark slide, see that the proper
carrier is in it, then raise the plate from the bath slowly, using a silver-wire hook
for the purpose. If the solution flows evenly over the film, the plate is ready;
but if, on the contrary, the solution flows greasy, then again lower the plate
and rock the dish gently for a minute or two. The film being fully sensitized,
the plate is carefully lifted out of the solution, both hands holding the plate in
such a manner as to avoid touching the film; allow the solution to drain from
the plate as much as possible, then lean the plate against the wall, the lower end
resting upon a pad of clean blotting-paper, so as to catch any
further draining; <span class="xxpn" id="p027">{27}</span>
now with a pad of blotting-paper or papier-joseph wipe the back of the plate
as dry as possible; this will prevent stains, and keep the dark slide from
rotting by the action of the silver solution.</p>

<p>The plate being drained, lay a piece of thin filtering paper in each lower
corner of the carrier, so that the plate will rest upon the filtering paper, which
will catch any further drainings from the film, and be a safeguard against
stains.</p>

<p>Now lay the plate face down in the carrier of the dark slide, close the door,
and fasten it.</p>

<p>The dark slide is now carried to the camera, and inserted in the grooves
previously occupied by the focussing screen, taking care that the sliding
shutter is next the inside of the camera; when pushed quite home, cover the
back with the focussing cloth; pull out the shutter, when the plate is ready
for the exposure.</p>

<p>The time of exposure will vary very much with the time of the year, and
with the amount of light falling upon the object being photographed. The
exact time can be found out only by actual practice, but the operator, in time,
by observation, will be able to guess it pretty correctly.</p>

<p>In taking the cap off the lens, be sure that the camera is not shaken, else
the picture will be spoilt.</p>

<p>The exposure being made, close the sliding shutter, remove the slide to the
dark-room, and close the door; lay the dark slide (with sliding shutter down)
upon the bench, open the back shutter, and, placing the pneumatic holder in
the centre of the plate, lift it out of the carrier.</p>

<p>Take the plate to the sink, and holding it face up, in the left hand, take the
developing cup in the right, and, with a quick motion, pour over the plate
sufficient developer to cover the whole film; the developer must go all over
the film in one even wave, for any hesitation in this will result in a stain;
pour upon the film only sufficient to cover it, and be careful to spill as little as
possible into the sink, or else the image will be thin, on account of the absence
of free silver washed off by the wave of developer.</p>

<p>Now rock the plate gently, so as to keep the developer flowing to and fro
over the film (but keep it there, don’t spill it off) and the image will soon
appear, faint at first, but growing gradually darker, the black lines of the
drawing being white and the white paper black. If the development be continued
too long the lines will eventually be veiled; therefore, as soon as the
finest details are out and well defined, place the plate under
the tap and allow <span class="xxpn" id="p028">{28}</span>
the water to well sluice the film all over; as soon as it is properly washed,
which can be seen by the water flowing evenly over, without greasy looking
lines, hold the negative up in front of the window, and examine for spots or
stains. If there be any present that at all interfere with the picture, at
once reject the negative, placing it in a pan filled with water, to be washed off
at leisure. Then start afresh.</p>

<p>The negative being satisfactory, give it another rinse under the tap, and
place it in the cyanide bath, where the unaltered iodide will speedily be dissolved.
Then it is withdrawn, and well washed under the tap. Whilst the water is
washing over the front, rub the back with the fingers or a sponge, and then
turn the plate over and allow the water to wash the back also. It is now
ready for immersion in the intensifier No. 1, where it remains until the film is
bleached almost white. Then it is thoroughly washed, drained, and flooded
with a small quantity of intensifier No. 2, which will at once turn the film to
an intense black, or if the action does not penetrate through to the back of the
film, continue the application until it does; again wash, then place the negative
on a rack to drain. When the water ceases to drip, flood the plate twice with
the filtered water varnish. Then place the negative on the rack to dry. When
dry, it is ready for printing on zinc. The negative may be varnished with a
benzole varnish, sold by the dealers under the name of positive or ferrotype
varnish. Negative varnish may be used, but unless very thin it is apt to be
sticky and render the negative easily marked by the heavy pressure it is subjected
to in the printing-frame.</p>

<p>Now lay the finished negative face down upon a piece of clean white paper,
when, if it is a good one, all the details of the original will show through,
clearly and distinctly; but if any of the details are missing or veiled over,
the negative will not do, and another must be made.</p>

<p>This process does not always work satisfactorily, but with care and cleanliness
no serious fault should arise.</p>

<p>Sometimes the bath may give what are called foggy images, which are indicated
by a veil over the lines. These can often be wiped off with a pledget of cotton-wool.
The addition of half a drachm of nitric acid to the eighty ounces of
bath solution, thorough mixing, and a rest for a few hours, will end this difficulty.
If the dark-room window be not of the proper color, fog will ensue;
therefore, the non-photographic experimentalist had better call in the aid of a
professional photographer in case of any difficulty in getting clear negatives.</p>

<p><i>Wilson’s Photographics</i> will be a profitable investment, as
it was published <span class="xxpn" id="p029">{29}</span>
before the advent of dry-plate photography, when the wet process reigned
supreme.</p>

<p>At the end of each day’s work the silver solution should be carefully poured
into the jug or bottle, and allowed to stand all night; then in the morning,
just before using, it should be filtered. The dish also must be carefully washed
out and put away in a corner where it has no chance of being soiled.</p>

<p>Such are the manipulations necessary for the production of a negative from
a line subject—<i>i. e.</i>, a drawing in black and white, in which the whole of the
picture is obtained by means of lines, or stipple, or by cross hatching. Flat
washes of color not being permissible, all effects of half tones, etc., are obtained
by lines, either thicker, or thinner, or closer, or further apart. Such a negative
is available for printing from, direct upon zinc, in either albumen or in
bitumen, for etching into relief, or for printing from as a lithograph.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="The Use Of Gelatine Dry Plates In Photo-engraving.">THE
 USE OF GELATINE DRY PLATES IN PHOTO-ENGRAVING.</h4>

<p>For making negatives for collographic printing either direct or by transfer,
gelatine dry plates may be used with as much certainty as the wet collodion,
so long as the operator can produce a result giving all the gradations of tone,
from the deepest shadow to the highest light; and as there are so many excellent
brands of plates in the market, it would be worse than useless to name any
brand here as having any distinct advantage over the rest, more especially as
the brand that the writer would be inclined to name, would perhaps, by the
majority of readers, be classed as a plate that they could not work. This being
so, for half-tone negatives, the author leaves the choice of the plate and the
manner of working to the operator, contenting himself with saying that the
criterion of suitability of a negative for yielding good results by any of the
processes treated of in this book, leaving out of the question entirely negatives
for line work, etc. (treated of in Parts I., II., and III.), is the same for giving
soft, delicate, and brilliant prints, either in platinum, carbon, or on albumenized
paper, resting assured that a negative yielding a hard black and white,
or a dirty flat print, by any of these three methods, will not give results any
different in collographic or transfer methods.</p></div>

<p>For line work negatives for printing upon zinc, for etching, or for transfers
to stone, ordinary gelatine dry plates are not useful, as it is almost impossible
to get that freedom from veil over the lines that it is absolutely necessary to
have; here the wet collodion is best as it is simplest,
easiest, and cheapest. <span class="xxpn" id="p030">{30}</span>
Still there are times when the most ardent wet-plate worker is obliged to
confess that the process has its shortcomings, most especially in dull weather,
when it is necessary, to get the result required, to give exposures from thirty to
sixty minutes; then, what with the plate drying and the want of pluck from the
bad light, it is impossible to get a result suitable for the work. In this case
the plate called the “Process” plate is a great boon. It is fairly rapid, and
gives intense negatives, without veil on the lines.</p>

<p>For making transparencies same size of original negatives, the best plan is to
place a large sheet of white paper in front of the copying camera, and rack the
lens out of focus, taking care that the white sheet of paper is sufficient to
illuminate the full size of the plate. Then in the dark-room place the negative
in the carrier of the dark slide, film side up, and carefully dust the surface
(also seeing that the back of the negative is clean) with a clean camel’s-hair
brush; dust also the film of a gelatine dry plate, and place it face down upon
the negative, close the slide, and insert it into the grooves of the camera and
expose to the light reflected through the lens from the white sheet of paper for
from five to twenty seconds, according to the density of the negative and the
intensity of the light; close the lens and the shutter, and remove it into the
dark-room for development.</p>

<p>By exposing a plate in this manner there is a far better chance of getting
absolute contact between the two plates, as the rays of light are parallel.</p>

<p>For making transparencies for printing upon copper-plates, first of all make
a grained negative the proper size, then when this is varnished and touched
up, make from it as above a transparency upon a gelatine chloride dry plate,
by which process it is more certain to get a suitable result for the process than
on a gelatine bromide dry plate.</p>

<p>No formula will be given here for developing these gelatine chloride plates
as each packet has full instructions for development which must be followed
implicitly.</p>

<p>For developing gelatine bromide dry plates for negatives, or for transparencies,
the following, a modification of the Ilford formula, will be found better
than using formula where the ammonia and bromide are mixed together.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="The Reproduction Of Negatives.">THE REPRODUCTION OF NEGATIVES.</h4>

<p>For the production of suitable collotype prints, the first consideration is the
negative, from which the printing surface is to be made. The requirements are,
a negative in which all the half-tones, both in the lights and in the shadows,
are reproduced in their proper gradations; the lights must not be too dense, or
the shadows too clear; the blackest portion of the negative must be that part
representing the highest light, and the only clear glass, that which represents
the deepest shadow; these negatives may be either wet collodion, or on ordinary
gelatine-bromide plates and reversed—<i>i. e.</i>, the mirror must be used behind the
lens. If it is desired to produce a collographic block from a negative already
in existence, and which may not be retaken, then it will be necessary to make
another negative. This may be done in many different ways; but whichever
way is adopted, the first and most important step is the production of a transparent
positive.</p></div>

<p>This transparent positive may be made on an ordinary gelatine-bromide plate,
or on a gelatine-chloride plate, and then from the transparent positive a negative
is made by transmitted light (in the enlarging camera), either the same size,
reduced or enlarged in size; or instead of using this class of transparency, by
far the finest results can be got by making the transparency in carbon tissue,
which can be used for both transmitted light, for enlarging or reduction in size,
and it can also be used for contact printing, when the reproduced and reversed
negative is required to be the same size as the original.</p>

<p>On page <a href="#p029" title="go to p. 29">29</a>
directions are given for the manipulations when gelatine dry
plates are used, so here we will confine ourselves to the production of negatives
from the carbon transparency. First of all, procure some carbon transparency
tissue, ready sensitized, cut this into sizes at least half an inch larger all round
than the negative, then cut a brown paper mask to fit all round the negative,
and to protect the margin of tissue from the action of light; this acts as a safe
edge to the tissue, enabling it to adhere to the glass support during the operation
of development. If it is only intended to reproduce a portion of the <span class="xxpn" id="p032">{32}</span>
original negative, the safe edge may be made by putting the mask just round
that portion of the image, but if the whole of the negative is required, put
it in a printing frame with a plate glass front, fix the brown paper mask
outside the negative, then place the sensitive carbon tissue the black side next
the negative film, and put in the backing, and back, and fasten it up. Next
expose it to the light for four or five times the time requisite to get an ordinary
silver print.</p>

<p>The carbon tissue having been exposed to light for the proper time, it is taken
into the dark-room, the edges are turned up so as to form a dish, and pinned
upon a small board; it is now coated with thin plain collodion, the surplus
being poured into a bottle kept for the purpose, and the board gently rocked
to and fro, so as to prevent the collodion running in ridges, or streaks. Now
allow the collodion to dry, then place the coated and exposed tissue in clean
cold water until it is quite limp, then slide underneath it a gelatinized glass
plate a little larger all round than the tissue, bring the gelatinized surface of the
glass plate and the collodionized surface of exposed tissue in contact under the
water, taking great care not to abrade the collodion; then lift the two out and
lay the glass down upon a bench, and cover it over with a piece of thin India-rubber,
or mackintosh, or oil-cloth. Hold the cover firmly on the bench with
the left hand; with the right use a strong squeegee vigorously. That
will expel all the water from between the two surfaces (collodion on the tissue,
and gelatine on the glass), and so bring them into absolute contact; now remove
the cover, lift the plate and examine the tissue through the glass, and if there
are no air-bells between the two surfaces the operation has been successful; but
if air-bells are present, <i>at once</i> plunge the plate into cold water, strip off the
tissue, and try again, but be careful to be quick about it, or there is a risk of
the tissue absorbing too much water, in which case great difficulty will be experienced
in getting it to lie flat upon the gelatinized glass.</p>

<p>The gelatinized plate upon which the exposed and collodionized tissue is
mounted is prepared as follows: Glass plates free from scratches and stains, are
placed in a weak mixture of hydrochloric acid and water, and rubbed with a
clean rag until free from grease and dirt; they are then washed under the tap,
and whilst wet are covered with:</p>

<p class="pcontinue">Soak
the gelatine in the cold water until it is soft, then melt at gentle heat,
add the bichromate, and when dissolved, filter, and coat the cleaned plate two
or three times, throwing the surplus away each time of coating; now stand the
coated plate on a rack to dry. Any quantity of these plates may be prepared
at a time, and used when required. When all the batch has been coated, the
rack may be removed into a warm corner, free from dust, until the plates are
dry, then expose the plates to the light for at least twenty minutes, when they
are ready for use for mounting the exposed and collodionized transparency
tissue upon.</p>

<p>After the tissue is mounted upon the glass plate, it is allowed to stand a few
minutes, then it is placed in a dish containing hot water (100°&nbsp;F.), and as soon
as the tissue compound shows signs of dissolving by exuding from under the
paper, lift the paper away, then rock the dish, and, if necessary, add more hot
water; then raise the plate and gently lave it with the hot water, until the whole
of the soluble pigmented gelatine is washed away, leaving a transparent positive
on the glass, which merely requires washing under the cold water tap, and
drying, to be finished. Now examine it closely, and if it contains the whole of
the details in the negative, and is free from dust spots, it may be put away to
dry, but if underexposed, or overexposed, or marred by spots not in the
original, then another must be done; but if care is taken to dust the surface of
the tissue, and the film of the negative with a camel’s-hair brush before printing,
and before collodionizing, and also to see that both the collodion and the
gelatine mixture are properly filtered, and that the water in which the coated
and exposed tissue is soaked is free from dirt, then there will be no difficulty
in getting a perfect transparency.</p>

<p>The transparency being obtained, if it is desired to make a negative larger
or smaller than the original, the transparency is placed in the enlarging camera
with the carbon film inside, and the negative made the requisite size, either on
a dry plate or on a wet collodion plate.</p>

<p>If a negative the same size is required, the transparency is placed face up in
the carrier of the dark slide, and the surface dusted; then take a dry plate, and
having also dusted its film, place it face down in contact with the transparency,
then close the dark slide and remove it to the camera, which should be previously
adjusted opposite a large sheet of white paper; now put in the dark
slide, draw the shutter, and expose to the sheet of paper, and develop as directed
on page <a href="#p030" title="go to p. 30">30.</a></p>

<p>By exposing in this manner, instead of direct to the light
(day or gas), the <span class="xxpn" id="p034">{34}</span>
rays projected through the lens fall upon the dry plate quite parallel, so securing
sharp negatives.</p>

<p>In making reversed negatives for collographic printing when wet collodion
is used, it is not absolutely necessary to use the mirror, as they may be made
upon polished glass (<i>i. e.</i>, not albumenized) dried, then coated with gelatine,
again dried, and stripped.</p>

<p>Some brands of dry plates can also be stripped, by first of all, after drying,
coating them with India-rubber solution, then with collodion, and soaking in
dilute fluoric acid; but great care and patience must be exercised, the preliminary
trials being made upon negatives of no particular value.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Stripping Collodion Films.">STRIPPING COLLODION FILMS.</h4>

<p>Negatives made by the wet collodion process can be easily stripped from the
glass support, and in such a condition are extremely handy, especially for
printing on collographic plates, or on zinc or copper, as, the film being flexible,
contact is more easily secured.</p></div>

<p>When it is intended to strip the film, the glass plate must be polished, <i>not
albumenized</i>, and after the negative is dried, strips of thick paper are pasted
along the four sides of the negative, with starch, or a solution of gum tragacanth;
the negative is then placed on a levelling stand and a sufficient quantity
of the following warm solution of gelatine is poured upon the plate (which
should be slightly warmed first) and spread all over it by means of a glass rod:</p>

<div class="tablebox"><div class="nowrap">
<table summary="stripping solution">

 <td class="tdleft padr">20</td>
 <td class="tdleft">ounces.</td></tr>
</table></div>
</div>

<p class="pcontinue">Soak the gelatine in the water until soft, melt by gentle heat, then strain
through two or three thicknesses of fine muslin, and pour upon the plate, using
three ounces for a plate 12 × 10; more or less, in proportion for different sizes.
The plate must be allowed to stay upon the levelling stand until the gelatine
has quite set, then put it on a rack to dry, in a current of cold air, for if heat be
used the gelatine will melt.</p>

<p>When the gelatine is <i>quite dry</i>, pass the blade of a penknife all around
underneath the strips of thick paper, when the negative film may be lifted
away from the plate.</p>

<p>In this condition the negative may be stored away without risk of being
broken, the only condition being, it must be kept free from dampness. <span class="xxpn" id="p035">{35}</span></p>

<p>Another plan of stripping is to coat the dry negative with a thick solution
of India-rubber in benzole, and allow it to dry on a levelling stand; then coat
with a thick plain collodion, to which a few drops of castor oil have been added.
When the collodion film is quite dry, place the plate in a dish of clean
water, strip off the film from the glass, then place the film between sheets of
clean blotting-paper to dry, or it may be allowed to dry on the plate.</p>

<p>Old collodion negatives that have been varnished may be stripped, but it is
rather a risky operation, and should never be attempted until a really good
carbon transparency has first been obtained.</p>

<p>The first step will be to remove the varnish, which is effected by soaking the
plate in</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="The Reversing Mirror.">THE REVERSING MIRROR.</h4>

<p>The mirror is a piece of perfectly plane glass, coated on the surface with a
thick film of pure silver, and highly polished. This silvered glass must be
mounted in a mahogany box, and fitted on the front of the camera, the lens
being fitted in front of the mirror, see Fig. 1. This mirror is placed in grooves
at an angle of forty-five degrees from the axis of the lens. So situated, it
receives the image projected by the lens, and reflects it on the focussing screen,
or sensitive plate in the camera. By this means a negative is obtained, which,
when looked through with the film between the operator and the glass, will
present the image in its proper position, whereas, if the lens be used without
the intervention of the mirror it will be necessary to have the glass between
the eyes and the film, to get the image in its proper position, and as the generality
of photographic negatives are taken without the intervention of the
mirror, they are called ordinary negatives in contradistinction to those made
through the mirror, which are called “reversed” negatives.</p></div>

<p>The silver surface of the mirror requires great care and attention to preserve
its lustre. If tarnished, it will make the exposure in the camera longer, besides
which, the cost of resilvering is too great to allow of the surface being spoiled
through carelessness. <span class="xxpn" id="p036">{36}</span></p>

<p>At the end of each day’s work, remove the mirror from the box and warm
it in front of the fire (not over a gas flame) just slightly, then wrap it carefully
in a piece of fine velvet, which has also been previously warmed, then
wrap it up in a piece of India-rubber or macintosh cloth, and put it in an air-tight
box; by doing this, the mirror, if well silvered at first, will last for a
year or two.</p>

<p>If the surface should become tarnished, get a square of very fine chamois
leather, and place in the centre a pellet of cotton-wool; then gather up the
leather and tie the wool in the centre, making a small globe about an inch
and a half in diameter; now warm the mirror, and after dipping the leather
globe into fine rouge, proceed to polish gently with a quick circular motion,
using little or no pressure—take care in doing this that the mirror, the leather,
and the rouge are quite dry, else the silver coat will come away—<i>verb sap</i>.</p>

<p>In purchasing a mirror be sure and get it large enough to take the cone of
rays from the lens it has to be used with; for a lens three inches in diameter,
the plane mirror should measure about 8&#160;×
3&#x202f;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#8260;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub> inches.</p>

<p>The box to hold this mirror should be made square at the side, fitting into
the rabbet of the camera front, so that when objects are to be photographed
that will do better lying on the ground than when fixed against the wall, the
mirror can be placed to look down upon the object.</p>

<p>For silvering the glass, one cannot do better than to quote the directions for
working Common’s process given by Major Waterhouse in the <i>Photographic
News</i>.</p>

<p>“The solutions recommended by Mr. Common are three:</p>

<div class="tablebox"><div class="nowrap">

 <td class="tdleft padr">Distilled Water</td>
 <td class="tdleft padr">10</td>
 <td class="tdleft">ounces.</td></tr>
</table></div></div>

<p>The above quantities are suitable for 250 square inches, consequently, an
ordinary copy mirror 8 × 6 would require rather more than two ounces of each
solution, and other sizes in proportion.</p>

<p>The caustic potash and distilled water must be quite pure. Ordinary caustic
potash will not answer at all. The best to use is known as <i>pure by alcohol</i>.</p>

<p>The glass surface to be silvered is carefully cleaned with strong nitric acid,
applied, as recommended by Mr. Browning, with a Buckle’s brush,
then well <span class="xxpn" id="p037">{37}</span>
washed in clean water, and after rinsing with distilled water, laid, face downward,
in a dish of distilled water until wanted.</p>

<p>Before cleaning the glass, it will be necessary to arrange for supporting it
face downward in the depositing dish, so that the surface to be silvered may be
quite horizontal, and just below the level of the fluid, which should be about
half an inch above the bottom of the dish.</p>

<p>I have generally used a large cork, about four inches in diameter, cemented
to the back of the plate, and fitted with three strings, by which it could be
suspended in a level position and adjusted to any height by winding the string
over a roller placed at a convenient height above the dish. When this
arrangement is not available, I fix on the back of the plate two ordinary
wide-mouthed bottle corks of equal thickness, in the positions shown in the
figure, and to these corks attach thin slips of bamboo running transversely
across the plate, and of sufficient length to rest on the sides of the dish, thus:</p>

<div class="figright imwth09" id="fig03">
<img src="images/i037.jpg" width="192" height="142" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span id="fig03caption">Fig. 3.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The slips of bamboo give the arrangement a certain
amount of spring, by which the height of the plate can
easily be regulated, by putting on weights until the surface
of the plate is just below the level of the fluid in
the dish.</p>

<p>To prepare the silvering solution: A sufficient quantity
of the silver solution, No. 1 (two ounces), is put
into a perfectly clean glass. Ammonia is dropped in
until the precipitate first formed is just redissolved.
The same quantity of potash solution, No. 2, as of silver is now mixed in, and
the precipitate again dissolved by ammonia. A little more silver solution is
then added to produce a distinct turbidity, and distilled water to make up the
quantity necessary to fill the depositing dish to about three-eighths or half an
inch, and the mixture is then filtered through cotton into another clean glass
vessel.</p>

<p>The same quantity (two ounces), of filtered solution of glucose, No. 3, as
was taken of silver and potash, is now mixed in, and the whole is poured into a
depositing dish (which should preferably be of glass, well cleaned with nitric
acid).</p>

<p>The glass plate is then taken out of the distilled water and laid face downward
on the silvering solution, being supported, as before described, just
above the surface, so that the solution does not cover its back.</p>

<p>Mr. Common places the requisite quantity of distilled water in
the dish in <span class="xxpn" id="p038">{38}</span>
which the mirror has been remaining face downward, and then, having lifted
the mirror up, pours in the undiluted silvering solution, together with the
glucose solution, stirs well together, and then carefully lowers the mirror again
into the dish.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after the immersion of the plate, the silvering action
begins, and, if things are going on well, a brilliant reflecting surface will be
seen at the back of the plate, and in forty minutes, or even less, a good deposit
of silver will be obtained. It is usually recommended to stop the action as
soon as the silvering fluid appears clear and free from turbidity, but it is not
always easy to see this.</p>

<p>After silvering, the plate is well washed, finishing with distilled water, and
dried off quickly. A slight cloudiness of the surface may appear, and must be
removed by polishing before the mirror can be used. It is better to allow the
mirror to remain a day or so before polishing, in order to harden the coating.</p>

<p>To polish the plate, it should be slightly warmed, and perfectly dry, and
rubbed very gently in small circles with a piece of very soft and dry chamois
leather, afterward using a little jewellers’ rouge.</p>

<p>Mirrors should always be kept in a dry place, and will require repolishing
from time to time.</p>

 Apparatus For Printing Upon Zinc." id="p039">
CHAPTER IV.
<span class="blksmaller">APPARATUS FOR PRINTING UPON
ZINC.</span></h3></div>

<p>A suitable negative (the subject being in line, <i>not half tone</i>) having been
obtained, the next stage toward producing a relief block is to make from that
negative a print in ink upon a sheet of zinc. To do this a sheet of polished
zinc is first of all subjected to the action of a solution of nitric acid, alum, and
water. It is then thoroughly washed, placed in a machine called a whirler,
then coated with a solution of albumen (white of egg) and bichromate of
potash; this coat or film of bichromated albumen should be dried over a
spirit lamp.</p>

<p>The negative is then placed, face uppermost, in a printing-frame, the coated
side of the zinc in contact with the face of the negative. The negative is now
exposed to the action of light.</p>

<p>The exposure being complete, the frame is taken into a room lighted by
yellow light, gas, or lamp-light, the zinc plate is removed, and its surface
covered with a thin film of transfer ink, by means of a type-printer’s roller;
then the zinc plate is immersed in clean cold water and the image developed
by gently rubbing it with a pledget of cotton-wool.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Polishing The Zinc.">POLISHING THE ZINC.</h4>

<p>Zinc plates suitable for photo-engraving can be obtained either in large
sheets, or cut to size as ordered, and, when new, require polishing with a damp
rag dipped in levigated pumice powder—<i>i. e.</i>, pumice powder washed in water,
so as to get rid of all grit.</p></div>

<p>Lay the plate upon a board covered with muslin and polish with a “from-and-to”
the body motion, not circular; do not use a great deal of pressure,
the object being to get the plate highly polished with a perfectly smooth
surface.</p>

<p>Plates that have been printed upon, and are not satisfactory, may be cleaned
and repolished.</p>

<p>Plates that are scratched require polishing with emery cloth. Scratches
interfere with the picture. <span class="xxpn" id="p040">{40}</span></p>

<p>To remove scratches, sprinkle the face of the plate with turpentine, then
rub with a piece of FF emery cloth stretched over a carpenter’s cork-covered
rubber. Use the same motion, to-and-fro, until all the turpentine has evaporated
and the surface of the zinc is polished. If the scratches are removed,
the plate is ready for use, but if not, then the operation must be repeated. If
the scratches are too deep for emery cloth alone, first use a piece of fine pumice
stone, followed by snake stone, pumice powder, rotten-stone, and rouge. Too
much care cannot be taken with the zinc plate at this stage, for, after the block
is etched, if it is discovered that the plate has not been properly polished, all
will have to be done over again, entailing a loss of time, labor, and materials.</p>

<p>Remember, that no matter what polishing agent is used, the plate must be
polished with a to-and-fro from the body motion, not a circular motion such
as is usual in polishing metal.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Graining The Plate.">GRAINING THE PLATE.</h4>

<p>The next operation is to give the plate a slight tooth so that the sensitive
solution will flow evenly over the surface. Do this by removing all traces of
grease.</p></div>

<p>This graining is done in a wooden tray, 24 inches by 18 by 6, lined with
asphaltum or gutta percha and mounted upon rockers; it is quite necessary
that the graining tray be of large size, as if only a little larger than the plate
the returning wave of acid water will mark the edges of the zinc.</p>

<p>Into this tray pour a quart of clean water, and add one drachm of nitric acid
and one ounce of a saturated solution of common alum. Place the plate in
this, face up, and commence rocking it at once or else the acid will mark the
surface, and it will require repolishing; rock slowly for five minutes, during
which time the polished surface will give way to a fine matt, like fine frosted
silver. Now remove the plate and rinse it under the tap, rubbing it gently with
a fine sponge, or a pledget of cotton to remove the scum or deposit formed by
the acid. The surface at this stage should be quite smooth; if it is at all
rough, the acid is too strong, and the solution must be diluted with water; if
the action of the acid is very slow, then a little more must be added; but it
will only be necessary to add more alum when the plate is a bluish color instead
of being a pearly gray.</p>

<p>A drop or two of acid will be required each time plates are to be grained.</p>

<p>In rubbing with sponge, or a pledget of cotton when under the tap, care <span class="xxpn" id="p041">{41}</span>
must be taken not to scratch the surface of the zinc, or else it
will need repolishing.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Coating The Plate With Sensitive Albumen.">COATING THE PLATE
 WITH SENSITIVE ALBUMEN.</h4>

<p>If the solution of albumen was poured over the plate and drained and dried,
the film would be too thick at the bottom and too thin at the top; it is, therefore,
necessary, to insure an even film of sensitive albumen, to subject the plate
to a quick circular motion, so as to spread the film of albumen evenly, and to
get rid of the surplus solution. This is effected by placing the grained zinc in
the jaws of an instrument called a whirler and made as follows:</p></div>

<p>Two pieces of wood, each half an inch thick, twelve inches long, nine inches
wide at one end, and six inches at the other; upon the narrow end of one piece
fix four screws, a piece of iron the shape of a
<img class="glyph-a"
 src="images/heavy-up-and-horizontal.jpg" width="40" height="60" alt="┻" />,
the top end of which is shaped
to fit into the socket of a carpenter’s brace (which must have the centre handle
revolving, not fixed); the cross piece must be flat, and pierced with four holes,
countersunk to admit of stout screws.</p>

<p>Place the two pieces of wood together, the
<img class="glyph-a"
 src="images/heavy-up-and-horizontal.jpg" width="40" height="60" alt="┻" />
piece between the two, and with
a piece of stout leather hinge the two together, nailing the leather not only on
the outside, but upon the top also; now screw a narrow batten on each of the
pieces, about an inch from the widest end, to keep the wood from warping.</p>

<p>Four inches from the top (the hinge being the top) bore a hole through both
pieces, and pass through a couple of strong leather laces; by one end fix these
on the outside of the cheek to which the iron
<img class="glyph-a"
 src="images/heavy-up-and-horizontal.jpg" width="40" height="60" alt="┻" />
is screwed, and on the outside
of the other cheek, seven inches from the top, hinge a piece of wood (so as to
fall toward the bottom) 5 inches by 2 by
<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#8260;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>&#xfeff;;
and in the centre of the batten
screwed on to prevent warping, fix a broad-headed nail or a turn-button, over
which the free end of the leather laces can be passed.</p>

<p>Now about half an inch from each end drive through the wood, six or eight
wire nails one inch long in a line, and so that the points project on the inside
of each cheek. Next fix the top of the iron into the socket of the brace and
the whirler is ready for use.</p>

<p>To use this instrument, lay it upon the bench, raise the upper jaw, place the
grained zinc behind the teeth (face out) close the jaw, and after seeing that the
face of the zinc is close up to the teeth, tighten the shoe lace, pass it over the
hinged piece (which is lying down close to the cheek), and around the batten
with two or three turns, then pass it back and tie the loose ends around the
iron shank at the top; then raise the hinged piece, which by
straining on the <span class="xxpn" id="p042">{42}</span>
leather laces will cause the jaws to grip the zinc plate tight and hold
it in position. (See Fig. 4.)</p>

<div class="imctr05" id="fig04">
<img src="images/i042.jpg" width="348" height="361" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 4. The Whirler.</div>
</div>

<p>Now lift up the whirler from the bench, grasping the handle of the brace
firmly in the right hand. Hold it at arm’s length, and by a series of quick
jerks set the plate revolving.
This will require a little
patience to do evenly and
rapidly, but with practice it
will become quite easy.</p>

<p>The plate is coated twice,
whirling it after each application
of the sensitive mixture.
The whirler is then laid upon
the bench, and the hinge piece
let down. This relaxes the
strain upon the leather laces,
and allows the jaw to be lifted
and the plate removed.</p>

<p>An inverted revolving egg-beater
may be made to serve
for the same purpose.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Drying The Coated Zinc.">DRYING THE COATED ZINC.</h4>

<p>The film of albumen now
requires drying, which should
be done over a spirit lamp. The best form of lamp is one of the small pocket
spirit stoves sold by ironmongers, and having the three supports for a kettle
cut away. The zinc is held over the flame and kept in constant motion, so as
to dry the film as quickly and evenly as possible; no fear need be felt at
applying too great a heat so long as the metal can be held comfortably in the
fingers. When dry, the plate is ready for printing upon.</p></div>

<p>For drying large plates, two or more of these stoves would be required, but
it is very easy to extemporize a suitable arrangement, by laying a large pad of
cotton saturated with spirits of wine in a tin dish, and setting it on fire; by
this means a stove of any desired dimensions can be prepared quickly. To
extinguish such a flame, cover it with a large sheet of zinc.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that the film on the zinc is now very sensitive to <span class="xxpn" id="p043">{43}</span>
light, therefore the preparation of the film must be done in a yellow light, as
must also the operation of placing it in the printing-frame, inking up, and
development; gas or lamp light may be used, as the film is not sensitive to
artificial light of a low actinic power.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="The Printing Frame.">THE PRINTING FRAME.</h4>

<p>The printing-frames used for this purpose must be of the box pattern, fitted
with stout plate-glass fronts, the cross bars behind being fitted with wooden
screws, instead of springs, as absolute contact can only be obtained between
the surfaces of the glass negative and zinc plate by means of
screw-pressure.</p></div>

<p>The front glass of the printing-frame must be kept perfectly clean, and
especial care must be taken that no grit be upon either glass, inside the frame,
or on the back of the negative, else the negative will be broken.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Timing And Exposure.">TIMING AND EXPOSURE.</h4>

<p>The time of exposure to light is measured by means of an actinometer,
which is simply an instrument in which is a strip of sensitive paper, exposed
under a graduated series of different thicknesses of translucent paper, each
division or gradation being distinguished by a number, thus: No. 1 has only
one thickness of paper over it; No. 2, two thicknesses, and so on. But on
account of the ever varying intensity of the light, a screen actinometer that is
reliable is almost an impossibility. The best must be closely watched in a
bright light, so that the tints are changed evenly.</p></div>

<p>Johnson’s actinometer is very simple and handy; it consists of a cubical box
with two lids, the inner one serving to press the paper in contact with the glass
of the outer lid; the outer lid has a circular opening with a narrow rectangular
strip in the centre transparent, the rest of the glass being covered with pigment
the color assumed by the sensitive paper after exposure to the light. When
the strip of sensitive paper inside has assumed this color, it is called one tint;
the strip of paper is then pulled forward, and another portion, quite white is
brought under the transparent portion of glass, and when the light has turned
that the color of the pigment, that counts two tints, and so on. The paper
used in the actinometer is ordinary albumenized paper.</p>

<p>The exposure of zinc in the printing-frame under a good line negative, will
be about six or eight tints in diffused light, but in direct sunlight the exposure
may be timed by the watch, a suitable line negative never requiring more than
from three to five minutes. <span class="xxpn" id="p044">{44}</span></p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Inking The Exposed Zinc.">INKING THE EXPOSED ZINC.</h4>

<p>The sensitive zinc having been exposed to light under the negative, next
cover the surface with a thin coating of litho-transfer ink, stone to stone.</p></div>

<p>For this purpose we require a type-printer’s composition roller, mounted
upon a litho stock. This roller must be perfectly smooth and cast in a solid
mould, as the line along the side, formed by a split mould would render it
useless for inking up a zinc plate. A roller eight inches long by five or six
inches in diameter is a useful size. We also require an inking slab, a palette
knife, a bottle of turpentine, with the cork cut so that the turpentine can be
sprinkled out without having to remove the cork, a tin of transfer ink, and a
linen cloth or two.</p>

<p>The inking slab may be made of smooth iron, or a suitable lithographic

CHAPTER V. <span class="blksmaller">PRINTING ON THE ZINC IN
ALBUMEN.</span></h3></div>

<p>The negative being ready for printing, select a piece of zinc a little larger
each way than the picture, polish, then grain, and after well washing it under
the tap and gently rubbing it with a fine sponge, or a pledget of cotton-wool,
place it in the whirler; again rinse under the tap, now invert the whirler and
set it revolving; then examine the surface of the zinc and see that there is no
dirt on the surface, but that it is quite smooth. If it is not, rinse it again
under the tap, and rub it gently with the sponge, and again rinse. This should
quite free the zinc from any deposit of dirt. Now whirl it so as to get rid of
as much as possible of the water, then pour over the surface of the zinc sufficient
to cover it, of the following solution (carefully filtered through cotton-wool):</p>

<div class="tablebox"><div class="nowrap">
<table summary="solution for printing on zinc">
<tr>
 <td class="tdleft padr">Albumen of one Egg.</td></tr>
<tr>
 <td class="tdleft padr">Water</td>
 <td class="tdleft padr">7</td>
 <td class="tdleft">ounces.</td></tr>
<tr>
 <td class="tdleft padr">Saturated Solution of Bichromate of Potash</td>
 <td class="tdleft padr">1</td>
 <td class="tdleft">ounce.</td></tr>
</table></div>
</div>

<p>Place the white of egg in a bottle containing a lot of small pieces of perfectly
clean glass, then add the water and shake it well for a minute; then add
the solution of bichromate and again shake it well. Now place a pledget of
cotton-wool in the neck of a glass funnel, and pass a few ounces of clean water
through (if this is not done, there will be difficulty in getting the albumen to
filter); drain as much as possible of the water away, and then filter the albumen
into a clean bottle; when all the solution has gone through, remove the cotton-wool
from the funnel, which well wash, then recharge with a fresh pledget,
pass some water through, and again filter the albumen solution through, this
time into a ten ounce glass-measure, which is to be used for pouring from
upon the zinc. The stem of the funnel should be long enough to reach the
bottom of the glass measure, so that the formation of air-bubbles be avoided,
which is impossible with albumen if the funnel is not below the surface of the
filtrate.</p>

<p>Of this, pour over the zinc sufficient to well cover the surface, letting
any surplus go into the sink; then set the whirler revolving, coat
again, and <span class="xxpn" id="p046">{46}</span>
again whirl; now examine the surface, and if it is free from dust, spots, and
air-bubbles, remove the zinc and dry it over the spirit stove. But if either
air-bubbles or dust be present, wash them off under the tap, and begin again.</p>

<p>The film being dry, get the printing frame ready, see that the surface of the
glass inside is quite clean and free from grit, as also the back of the negative,
taking special care that the ridge of varnish which often forms at the bottom
of the negative be removed, as the slightest inequality of surface will surely
cause disaster directly the screws exert their pressure.</p>

<p>Do not lay the negative into the frame flat upon the glass, but slide it in
from one side, so as to carry any dust away from the glass front of the printing
frame.</p>

<p>The negative being in the frame, film side up, lay the coated zinc upon it,
face down, judging the proper position and placing the zinc flat down upon the
negative; now put a piece of brown paper over the back of the zinc, then place
the back of the printing frame in place, fasten down the cross bars and apply
the pressure screws, evenly and gently.</p>

<p>Do not screw one side tight before the other has been touched, but screw
down so as to tighten all as evenly as possible.</p>

<p>Even pressure being applied, see that the front of the frame is clean, and
then expose to direct sunlight for five minutes. Remove the frame to the
dark-room, unfasten the cross bars and remove the zinc, taking great care to
avoid scratching its film against the film of the negative.</p>

<p>After wiping the inking slab with clean linen place a piece of the transfer
ink, about the size of a small bean, upon the upper corner, sprinkle this with
a little turpentine, and mix them with the palette knife until they are of about
the consistency of printing ink.</p>

<p>Now with the palette knife spread some of this mixture as far as possible
over the inking slab, and then distribute it with the composition roller. Roll
to and fro, across and diagonally, until there is a thin, even coating of ink all
over the slab (not touching the corner where the ink was mixed with the turpentine)
and upon the roller; if the mixture is too dry and refuses to spread,
sprinkle on a little more turpentine, but do not use too much, else it will take a
long time to evaporate.</p>

<p>The roller having a coat of rather moist ink spread evenly upon it, place the
exposed zinc, face up, on a piece of clean white paper, and proceed to roll it
briskly to and fro, using a moderate amount of pressure, until the whole of
the turpentine has evaporated; it should leave a thin coat of
ink with an even <span class="xxpn" id="p047">{47}</span>
matt surface, not thick enough to quite hide the yellow film of the sensitive
albumen, as, if it does hide it, too much has been put on, and it will most likely
smear in development.</p>

<p>If, after first applying the roller, the ink on the zinc seems likely to be too
thick, at once wipe the roller dry, and then roll the zinc briskly until the coat
of ink is perfectly even and the turpentine evaporated.</p>

<p>At this stage everything depends upon getting the coat of ink even. If there
are patches of thick and patches of thin, sprinkle some turpentine upon the
slab, quickly charge the roller, and roll up the zinc again, until the coat of ink
is thin and even.</p>

<p>An even coat of ink being obtained, the zinc is laid in a tray containing
clean cold water of a sufficient depth to well cover the surface. Now take a
pledget of cotton-wool and rub the surface gently, when the ink covering the
albumen protected from light by the black portions of the negative, will wash
away, leaving the picture on the zinc in ink; if the finer details do not develop
easily, continue the rubbing with the cotton-wool, but be careful not to rub so
hard as to scratch the ink lines.</p>

<p>All details being developed, rinse the picture under the tap and put it away
to dry, which at ordinary temperature will take but a few minutes.</p>

<p>The chances of failure in this portion of the process are, first of all, air
bubbles and dust spots in the film. These will at once declare themselves.
The remedy, is increased care and cleanliness.</p>

<p>If, upon development, some of the lines are missing, then the zinc and the
negative have not been in actual contact, or if the finer lines wash away easily,
then the exposure has not been long enough; whilst if it has been too long,
either the finer details are covered up or the whole refuses to part with any ink.</p>

<p>A satisfactory print, showing all the lines of the original having been
obtained, dry, by first blotting off the water, then by gentle heat, after which
the zinc is ready for the etching room.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="p048"
 title="Chapter VI. Printing on Zinc in Bitumen.">
 CHAPTER VI. <span class="blksmaller">PRINTING
 ON ZINC IN BITUMEN.</span></h3></div>

<p>The process described in the previous chapter is most suitable for printing
on zinc, for blocks that are not overburthened with fine lines, and is intended
for rough printing; and also, when from want of sunlight, and the exigencies
of business, the exposure has to be made by electric light; but when the subjects
are very fine, and the blocks must be of the very best, it will be better to print
the image in bitumen; then the first etching can be done without having to
ink up previous to immersing in the acid bath (which must be done after
developing the inked albumen image), so getting the sharpest possible results,
and also securing better depth to close work than when the inking up has to
be done before biting in.</p>

<p>Now the generally accepted idea of bitumen is, that it requires such a long
exposure to light as to be practically useless, except for direct sun printing;
but that only stands good where the bitumen is not prepared properly and
where too thick a film is used upon the plate.</p>

<p>By preparing the bitumen as described below and taking care to have a very
thin film of the sensitive bitumen upon the zinc plate, then the exposure either
to sunlight or electric light is not more than double that of albumen.</p>

<p>There is one especial virtue in a bitumen film. If by chance too much
exposure to light has been given, a prolonged immersion in the developing
liquid (turpentine) will remedy the defect, whereas if an albumen image be
over-exposed it is quite spoiled, and the work must be done again.</p>

<p>We are still upon the subject of line work, and the same class of negative
desirable for printing on an albumen film is necessary for printing upon
bitumen, viz., the lines must be clear glass without veil, and the rest of the
negative must be sufficiently opaque to stop the passage of light.</p>

<p>The sensitive solution of bitumen is made by procuring a small quantity of
photographic bitumen or asphaltum, and powdering it in a clean, dry mortar.
Next take a clean and dry glass beaker, half filled with methylated ether, and
pour into it the powdered bitumen, stirring with a glass rod for a few minutes;
now cover the beaker with a piece of thin sheet India-rubber, and upon that <span class="xxpn" id="p049">{49}</span>
place a piece of plate glass, so as to make the vessel as nearly air-tight as possible.
Allow to stand a few hours, then stir up again, and again allow to stand,
this time all night. Then pour away the ether, draining the liquid as closely
as possible, so as to get rid of all those constituents which are soluble in the ether.
Now add some more fresh ether, stir thoroughly, and again allow to stand and
settle, putting on the cover as before, so as to prevent evaporation. After
again settling, the ether is poured off, and all liquid and semi-liquid matter
carefully drained away. More ether is added, and the operation is repeated
until the added ether, after standing all night, is nearly or quite colorless. The
residue in the beaker is removed to a glass plate and spread out over its surface,
so that any ether remaining may quickly evaporate. During this evaporation
of the ether, the bitumen must be protected from the action of white light.</p>

<p>By thus purifying with ether we get rid of those constituents of the bitumen
which are not sensitive to light, and thus we secure a film of bitumen sensitive
to the action of light.</p>

<p>When the ether has evaporated, take of the residue half an ounce and dissolve
it in pure benzole (free from water) fifteen ounces, allow it to stand all night,
then filter it through filtering paper (placing a sheet of glass over the funnel to
prevent evaporation). It will keep six months.</p>

<p>New zinc plates will require polishing first with rotten stone, and finishing
with rouge, but plates that have been used should be first polished with fine
emery cloth, followed by pumice powder, then by rotten stone, and finished
with rouge, remembering that a circular motion must not be used.</p>

<p>If, after polishing, the surface is at all greasy, immerse it in the graining
bath used for the albumenized plates, wash well and rub away the scum; then
with a perfectly clean piece of blotting paper, remove the water from the surface
and dry it over the spirit flame.</p>

<p>To coat a piece of zinc with bitumen, place it in the whirler, and when fixed
in position, dust the surface with a clean camel’s-hair brush; then flow over it
sufficient of the filtered bitumen solution in benzole, then lower the whirler
and set it in motion; whirl rapidly for about a minute. This will equalize the
coat or film of bitumen and get rid of superfluous solution. When taken from
the whirler the plate will be ready at once for the printing frame. These
plates do not deteriorate, and a stock of them may be prepared and stored
away in the dark till wanted. Great care must be taken not to allow the
slightest ray of daylight to fall upon them, else the action once set up, will
continue, and spoil the plate. <span class="xxpn" id="p050">{50}</span></p>

<p>On examining the zinc plate after removing it from the whirler, it will be
difficult to realize that there is really a sufficient film of bitumen on the zinc,
but there will be quite sufficient.</p>

<p>In printing upon bitumen from negatives that have been varnished, it will
be as well to rub the varnished surface of the negative with a pledget of cotton
dipped in dry French chalk.</p>

<p>The same care in putting into the printing frame, as enjoined in the chapter
on zinc printing with bichromated albumen, is requisite with these plates, as is
also the applying the pressure by means of the screws. The exposure to light
will vary from ten minutes in the sun, to two or three hours in the shade.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Developing The Image.">DEVELOPING THE IMAGE.</h4>

<p>To develop, place the exposed plate, face up, in a shallow tin tray, and
pour into the tray sufficient turpentine to cover the plate; rock the tray so as
to keep the solution in motion, and (if the exposure has been right) the image
will gradually make its appearance; the bitumen protected from the action of
light by the dense portions of the negative gradually dissolves away. As the
development approaches completion, great care must be used, and when the
last detail is visible, remove the plate, and rinse it with water from a rose top;
now, if the image is quite perfect, immerse the plate at once in a mixture of
nitric acid and water, the acid being just strong enough to taste. Keep the
tray containing this acid solution rocking for about a minute, then remove
the plate, and wash it thoroughly, rubbing it very gently with cotton-wool.
If the exposure under the negative has been barely sufficient, the image will be
too delicate for touching, so before rubbing it with the cotton-wool, try some
portion of the margin, and if that stands the friction, it is all right; if not,
be content with rinsing with water.</p></div>

<p>The immersion in the acid water will have removed the shiny appearance of
the zinc, and the matt surface will enable the operator to see if all the requisite
details of the image are visible. If not, and they are covered with bitumen,
another immersion in the turpentine will complete the development; but if any
of the lines are rotten or the details are dissolved away, the exposure has been
too short, and the plate will require repolishing and another exposure.</p>

<p>The image being satisfactory, the water is blotted off with clean blotting
paper and allowed to dry. <i>Don’t use heat for drying.</i> It may then be exposed
to light for a few minutes. This is not absolutely necessary, although it tends
to make the image finer. The plate is now ready for etching in relief.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="p051"
 title="Chapter VII. Direct Transfers to Zinc.">
CHAPTER VII. <span class="blksmaller">DIRECT TRANSFERS
 TO ZINC.</span></h3></div>

<p>We have now treated of the various stages necessary to obtain a photographic
transfer upon zinc, from a drawing or engraving, in line, in dot, or in stipple,
first by making therefrom, in the camera, a negative—same size, reduced, or
enlarged—and from that negative a print on zinc, either in ink on an albumen
basis, or in bitumen.</p>

<p>These transfers can be used, either for yielding re-transfers for lithographic
press, or (as is at present our intention) for etching into relief, for use as blocks
for printing from letter-press.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to instruction for etching these photographic transfers into
relief, we will consider the method of dealing with the direct transfer of drawings,
in line or chalk, to zinc, without the intervention of photography.</p>

<p>For direct transfers to zinc, the picture is drawn by the artist the exact
dimensions of the finished block; if in line, on ordinary lithographic writing
transfer paper, in ordinary lithographic writing ink, just in the same way that
an ordinary line subject is treated for ordinary lithography.</p>

<p>If the subject is in chalk, it may be drawn on a grained lithographic stone,
which is rolled up, etched, washed out, again rolled up, then the transfer is
pulled; or the picture may be drawn upon specially prepared transfer paper,
like Josz’s polygraphic transfer paper, or other grained paper made for the
purpose; or the subject may already be on stone, as a lithograph, or it may be
a copper-plate engraving, in which case transfers are pulled and then put down
upon zinc in the ordinary way.</p>

<p>In making drawings on lithographic transfer paper, great care must be taken
to avoid touching the surface with the fingers, as finger-marks will transfer and
roll up black. In line work all lines must be firm and black; no attempt
must be made to get effect by using thin or pale ink.</p>

<p>In chalk work, also, the drawing must be firm and strong, and the corrections
and alterations made on the transfer, not left to be done on the stone. If the
corrections or alterations are small, they may be removed with an ink eraser, or
by careful washing with turpentine, so that all the chalk is
removed; if the <span class="xxpn" id="p052">{52}</span>
correction be large, paste a piece of clean transfer paper over the place, spreading
the paste as thin as possible; gum must not be used.</p>

<p>The drawing on transfer paper being obtained, the next step is to transfer it
to stone; then, after rolling up and proving, another transfer is made, which is
to zinc.</p>

<p>From an engraved copper plate a transfer is made on India or upon Scotch
transfer paper, on either a copper-plate press or a lithographic press, and then
transferred direct to the zinc.</p>

<p>The engraved copper plate is first of all examined to see that all the old ink
is out of the lines; if not, wash with turpentine and wipe quite dry; then, in
a piece of clean linen rag, tie up some plate re-transfer ink; warm the copper
plate, either on the hot plate or over a Bunsen burner, until it can be barely
held in the hand; then, holding it in a piece of cloth to protect the fingers, rub
in the ink tied up in the linen rag, until sufficient is melted to well cover the
surface, taking care to see that the ink is rubbed well into the lines. Then
take a piece of clean, soft rag and wipe off the ink from the surface of the plate
carefully, so as not to remove it from the reversed lines; this is best secured by
wiping across the lines, not with them. When the surface of the plate is quite
free from ink, rub the lower part of the palm of the hand upon a ball of
whiting, and proceed to polish the surface of the plate. Do not get too much
whiting upon the hand, else it may stick to the ink and prevent it adhering to
the transfer paper.</p>

<p>Now place a piece of clean transfer paper (India or Scotch), a little larger
than the plate, face downward upon a piece of clean paper, sponge the back
with a damp sponge, then let it lie a few minutes, so as to get evenly damp all
through.</p>

<p>Now see that the press is ready. If a copper-plate press is to be used, see
that the bed is free from grit, and that the blankets are in place; if a lithographic
press is to be used, put in a stone, wipe it free from grit, and see that
the scraper is all right; remove the tympan if of leather, but if of zinc or millboard
it is all right. Now put the inked and polished copper plate upon the
stone, and the damp transfer paper, face down, upon the copper plate; then
upon the transfer paper place a piece of printer’s blanket, turn down the
tympan, or put a piece of thin millboard over the blanket, run the bed of the
press under the scraper, turn down the lever, and, if necessary, adjust the
pressure (a good nip is necessary), then run the bed through; now raise the
lever, pull out the bed, lift the tympan and blanket, reverse
the plate, and pull <span class="xxpn" id="p053">{53}</span>
through again. Now gently warm the plate, and carefully lift away the
transfer paper, which should contain the picture with every line firm and
sharp; if it is not so, sufficient pressure has not been used, or the transfer paper
has been made too damp, or sufficient ink has not been put into the lines.</p>

<p>The transfer, either drawn in line or in chalk, or from a plate, being obtained,
it is next transferred to a polished litho stone. Of course, the picture can be
at once transferred to the zinc which it is intended to etch, but it will be found
best to first of all transfer to stone, then from the stone pull a transfer, and
transfer that to the zinc, so that in case of an accident during the etching
another plate can be quickly prepared. Before placing them upon the stone,
the prepared transfers should lie in a damping book until evenly damp.</p>

<p>Now take a polished litho stone and place it in front of a fire or in the sun
until it is quite dry, then place it upon the bed of the press, and adjust the
pressure; then place the transfer upon the stone in such a manner that it lies
without any slurring. Next place a piece of clean paper upon the transfer,
then the blanket, lower the tympan, run in the carriage, lower the lever, and
pull through; then lift the lever, draw back the carriage, turn the stone round
and pull through again, then sponge the back of the transfer with water and
pull through again, repeating the damping, and pulling through three or four
times. Now with a wet sponge saturate the back of the transfer with water,
and lift away the paper, then wash away the composition, leaving the image
on the stone; now cover it with thick gum solution, and allow it to dry.</p>

<p>If more than one transfer is in hand at a time, they are trimmed as closely
as possible and pasted with very thin paste close together upon a large piece of
paper, and then all can be transferred at one operation.</p>

<p>The gum upon the stone being dry, wash it off carefully with clean water,
then roll up with transfer ink. Clean away any dirt there may be with sponge
and snake stone; where the snake stone cannot be used, a piece of pointed wood,
dipped into acid gum, will clear way the dirt. Take care to have the wet
sponge handy so as to prevent the acid spreading upon the work; now roll up
as strong as possible, then etch, by passing over water acidulated with nitric
acid of such a strength that it just slightly effervesces when the stone is touched;
saturate a sponge with the weak acidulated water and go gently over the stone,
then with another sponge charged with clean water, wash off the acid. Now
again roll up with transfer ink as strong as possible, and pull the transfer.
Chalk drawings are transferred to stone in the same way, then etched, but the
acid water is allowed to act a little longer than for a line transfer,
and after <span class="xxpn" id="p054">{54}</span>
washing away the etching solution, the picture is washed out with clean turpentine,
then wiped with a sponge, gummed in, fanned dry, moistened with a
wet sponge, and the water removed. Then the image is rolled up with transfer
ink, and the transfers pulled for subsequent etching.</p>

<p>To transfer to zinc, take a piece of polished zinc and immerse it in the graining
bath (page <a href="#p040" title="go to p. 40">40</a>) for about a minute; then remove it, wash it under the tap, and
rub it with soft sponge; then wipe it dry with a soft rag, and warm the plate
slightly; lay it upon a litho stone in the press, lay the transfer (which has
been lying in the damping book) upon the zinc plate; lay upon the transfer
the piece of blanket, lower the tympan and pull through; then damp the back
of the transfer, pull it through again; then reverse the plate, dampen the back
of the transfer, pull through again; again dampen the back of the transfer, and
again pull through; now saturate the transfer with water, peel off the paper,
remove the composition, and apply with a sponge a sufficiency of a solution of
gum (thickness of cream), 5 ounces; decoction of nutgalls, 10 ounces. The
decoction of nutgalls is made as directed on page <a href="#p056" title="go to p. 56">56.</a></p>

<p>Allow this to stay on the zinc for about a minute, then wash off, cover with
plain gum, fan dry, and dip a sponge in gum and rub over the plate; now dip
a soft rag into the gum, then into the etching ink (page <a href="#p057" title="go to p. 57">57</a>) mixed with a little
cocoanut oil or mutton fat and middle varnish, continuing the application of
gum and ink until the whole of the picture is sharp, black, and strong. Be
sure and keep the plate well covered with gum and the ink as thick as possible.</p>

<p>The plate is now dusted with finely powdered resin, sponged with a wet
sponge, and then is placed in the etching trough containing water and just
sufficient nitric acid to taste; in this the plate remains about half a minute,
rocking the etching trough gently all the time; now remove the plate, wash it
under the tap, rubbing gently back and front with a sponge, then dry by gentle
heat; next coat the back, edges, and margin and portions of the front which
are too large to etch away, with thin shellac varnish. When dry proceed to
etch as directed in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Instead of inking up with the rag after etching with the acid gum, wash off,
then roll up with a leather roller charged with the etching ink mixed with a
little cocoanut oil, and used as stiff as it is possible to work it, until the image
has taken in all possible, damping the zinc with a sponge directly it shows any
signs of getting dry; then dampen slightly, and repeat as above. Next immerse
it in the etching bath as before; wash well, and dry; coat the back, edges and
margin on the front with shellac varnish, when the plate will be ready for
etching.</p>

 title="Chapter VIII. Etching Line Transfers.">
 CHAPTER VIII. <span class="blksmaller">ETCHING
 LINE TRANSFERS.</span></h3></div>

<p>For etching transfers on zinc, whether photographic or direct, we shall
require the following apparatus: A slab of iron about 24 × 18 inches and
<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#8260;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub> or
1 inch thick, supported horizontally upon four legs, and heated by an atmospheric
burner, arranged somewhat like a gridiron so that the heat is even all
over. A set of rollers on litho stock, one of leather, one of flannel, and one
or two glazed rollers, the same as lithographers use for tint printing—we also
require an etching box—<i>i. e.</i>, a wooden tray, 30 × 24 inches, and 8 inches deep,
well made of seasoned wood, lined with either pitch (with a little tallow added),
or gutta-percha, and mounted upon rockers.</p>

<p>This box will require a firm table for its support during the etching, said
table standing as close as convenient to a sink and water tap.</p>

<p>The other requisites used during etching, are, nitric acid, turpentine, gum
Arabic of a good quality, some powdered nutgalls, three or four sponges, some
finely powdered resin, a flat camel’s-hair brush, a solution of shellac in
spirits of wine, and the following inks:</p>

<p>First the etching ink, composed of beeswax one-quarter ounce, Russian
tallow two ounces, bitumen half an ounce, middle varnish two ounces.</p>

<p>Melt these together in a pan over a fire, or Bunsen burner, stirring well
during the operation, so as to mix them thoroughly; when all are melted, add
five ounces of ordinary letterpress printing-ink, and thoroughly mix; then
allow to boil and continue the heat until the gas escaping from the bursting
bubbles explodes upon the application of a lighted taper; then remove all from
the fire, and allow to cool.</p>

<p>For a hard ink, for use after the plate is etched deep enough, and the resist
is cleaned off, mix</p>

<div class="tablebox"><div class="nowrap">

<p>Now, with these and a solution of gum Arabic (in cold water), the thickness
of cream, add one-quarter pint of a decoction of nutgalls to each quart of gum
solution. The decoction of nutgalls is made by adding one-quarter pound of
bruised nutgalls to one and one-half pints of water, in an earthenware vessel
(not metal); boil, then allow to stand at the fire and simmer gently for six
hours, keeping the vessel covered over; then allow to cool, filter and add the
proper quantity to the above gum solution.</p>

<p>We will assume that a suitable place is provided for carrying on the operations
to be described, in the shape of plenty of bench room, and a good light
to work by.</p>

<p>The first stage in etching a zinc plate in relief is, to slightly warm it upon
the hot plate, then allow it to cool (by-the-bye, it will be very convenient to
have a clean litho stone handy for placing the plate upon to cool quickly).
The plate being cold, with a piece of soft sponge carefully smear it over with
the gum solution, allow the gum to dry, spontaneously, in a cold current of
air; if heat be applied the gum will crack and bring away the image from the
plate.</p>

<p>Whilst the gum is drying, with a palette knife place equal parts of transfer
ink (page <a href="#p044" title="go to p. 44">44</a>) and of etching ink
(page <a href="#p054" title="go to p. 54">54</a>) upon one corner of the inking slab,
then thin to the consistency of cream, with middle varnish, thoroughly incorporating
the three ingredients with the palette knife.</p>

<p>Now place a little of this ink upon the leather roller and roll vigorously
upon the slab, so as to distribute the ink thoroughly upon both roller and slab;
be careful not to get too much ink on the roller, nor to have it too thin; in
fact, work the ink as stiff as is possible.</p>

<p>Now lay the zinc upon a piece of clean paper, and sponge it gently over
with a wet sponge, so as to loosen the film of gum, then squeeze the sponge
nearly dry, and pass it over the plate again, so as to insure it being evenly
damp all over, but be careful not to make it too dry.</p>

<p>Now proceed to roll up, by passing the charged roller to and fro over the
plate, using moderate pressure and slow motion, recharging the roller at short
intervals from the inking slab. Occasionally use the damp sponge so as to
keep the plate sufficiently damp to resist the ink.</p>

<p>If the roller slides instead of rolling, wipe it with an old linen rag, which
will remove the moisture; then recharge the roller again upon
the slab. <span class="xxpn" id="p057">{57}</span></p>

<p>The rolling is continued until the whole image is an intense black, when it
is carefully dusted over with very finely powdered resin applied with a broad
camel’s-hair brush, taking care that all the image gets covered. Then rub it
gently with a wet, soft sponge and place it in the etching box containing a
mixture of water and nitric acid, the acid being only just perceptible to the
taste.</p>

<p>The plate should remain in this for one minute (the box being kept rocking);
it is then removed, and thoroughly washed back and front under the tap.
Rub it gently with a clean soft sponge.</p>

<p>This etching is merely to remove any traces of gum or dirt from the zinc
which would interfere with the shellac varnish holding.</p>

<p>Now dry the plates, using gentle heat, then coat the back with thin shellac
varnish to protect it from the acid; do the same to the margin of the picture
on front, also varnish the centre of any very broad whites up to half an inch
of the image, so that the acid dissolves no more zinc than is necessary. Now
examine the image carefully, and if any of the lines are defective touch them
up, and make any alterations and additions required.</p>

<p>The plate is now ready for the first etching, for which purpose a little nitric
acid is added to the water in the etching tray—precise directions cannot be
given as to how much acid to add, as so much depends upon the area of zinc
on the plate that requires dissolving; practice, however, will soon enable the
operator to judge the proper quantity. If too much acid is added, the plate
will quickly be covered with myriads of minute bubbles, in which case it must
be instantly removed, well washed, and the bath diluted with water before the
plate is reimmersed. If, on the other hand, there is too little acid present, the
action is too slow, and more must be added.</p>

<p>The first etching must be carefully watched, and the rocking continued, until
the application of the finger-nail to the margin shows that the zinc inside has
been dissolved away to a depth of about the thickness of a visiting card.</p>

<p>The first etching is the most important of the whole, as unless a sufficient
depth be attained the sharp lines will not be obtained; and as the ink is not
yet capable of resisting too strong acid, great care must be taken that the work
is not damaged; proceed cautiously, adding acid from time to time as required.</p>

<p>As a rule, the first etching will take from five to ten minutes (the tray being
kept rocking all the time).</p>

<p>When it is judged that the first etching has been carried far enough, remove
the plate from the tray, wash it well under the tap, rubbing gently with
a <span class="xxpn" id="p058">{58}</span>
sponge, so as to remove the scum left by the acid, dry by means of gentle heat,
then allow it to cool.</p>

<p>When the plate is quite cold, smear it over with gum solution, and with a
piece of cardboard, fan the gum dry.</p>

<p>Now sprinkle the inking slab with turpentine, and with a cloth wipe the
slab clean. Take a piece of etching ink and thin it with middle varnish,
mixing them well with the palette knife upon the slab; now take the leather
roller, and with the palette knife place a little of the ink upon it, and roll up
on the slab until both roller and slab are well coated; but on no account must
there be too much ink, nor must it be too thin.</p>

<p>Now lay the zinc down on the bench, on a piece of clean paper, and with
the wet sponge carefully wash off the gum; then wipe all superfluous water
off the plate, and roll up with the leather roller charged as above; roll the
plate first one way, and then the other, keeping the zinc evenly damp all over,
else the ink will catch in the whites, and probably spoil the picture. When
the rolling is completed, and as much ink as possible has been piled on, the
zinc will be nearly dry. If not, allow it to stand in a cold current for a little
time, then take it to the drawer in which the powdered resin is kept, and
smear the plate all over with the powder. Now brush as much of the resin
away as will come, using the brush from all sides, so that all the lines get
evenly coated, not only on the top, but upon the sides; this being done, take a
damp sponge and carefully remove the superfluous resin from the whites, or
unprotected zinc.</p>

<p>The plate is now ready for the second etching, and the solution in the etching
tray must be reinforced by the addition of a little acid; but do not add
too much at once. It will be far best to add a little at a time, and then, as
soon as the zinc shows there is no action going on, add a little more; an easy
and simple method of ascertaining whether any acid be present or not is to
wipe the bare metal with the tip of the finger, and if that spot (which will be
brighter than the surrounding parts) does not speedily resume its dingy color,
the acid is exhausted.</p>

<p>The plate being immersed in the solution, set the tray rocking, and pay
attention to the remarks above. At the end of ten minutes remove the plate
from the tray, wash it under the tap, rub it gently with soft sponge, then remove
as much of the water as possible, and examine the progress made by the acid.
This can be seen by the lines being bare below the ink, in which case the
etching has been carried far enough, and if not stopped, there would be
danger <span class="xxpn" id="p059">{59}</span>
of under-cutting; if, however, no progress has been made, add a little more
acid to the solution, replace the zinc, and rock again for another five or ten
minutes.</p>

<p>The second etching being effected, the zinc is carefully washed, and the scum
left by the acid is carefully sponged away; now stand the zinc up near the hot
plate, so that it will get the benefit of a gentle heat, and when quite dry lay it
upon the hot plate (which should be heated to a temperature of 120° to
150°&nbsp;F.) face up, with a piece of brown paper between the zinc plate and the hot
plate.</p>

<p>As soon as the zinc plate begins to get hot, there will be a tendency to curl
slightly away from the hot plate, which, if allowed, would prevent the ink
being evenly melted. To prevent this, take a brad-awl in each hand, and press
down the sides of the zinc, taking care not to touch any of the picture.</p>

<p>Allow the zinc to remain on the hot plate until the ink and resin are melted
and run down to the bottom of the etching, then remove it and lay it on the
cold slab until the plate is cold.</p>

<p>When cold, smear the plate with the gum solution, fan it dry (<i>never use heat
for drying the gum</i>), moisten with wet sponge, roll up again (use the leather
roller), using the ink pretty stiff on the inking slab; keep the surface of the
zinc well moistened. When the roller gets too much water upon it, pass a piece
of damp cheese-cloth over it to remove the water; then roll the roller vigorously
on the slab until it again bites the ink. Continue rolling the zinc until all
portions have received due attention from the roller. N. B.—Some of the
closest work will be quite blocked up this time, and each subsequent rolling
will block up more and more, until only the very open work will be left.</p>

<p>Now allow the zinc to get dry, then cover it with resin, brushing from all
sides, so as to coat the sides of the lines as well as the top, and then remove
all superfluous resin from the whites with a damp sponge. The zinc is now
ready for the next etching, for which more acid is added to the solution in
the etching tray.</p>

<p>Rock the tray carefully, watching the zinc to see that the acid is neither too
weak nor too strong, until the progress can be seen by examining the plate;
the time, with the proper quantity of acid, is twenty to thirty minutes.</p>

<p>When the etching has proceeded far enough, after washing and sponging,
again allow it to dry, then place it upon the hot plate until the ink is melted
and runs down the sides of the lines; then cool, smear with gum, fan dry,
moisten with sponge, and roll up as before; dry, cover with resin,
using a <span class="xxpn" id="p060">{60}</span>
camel’s-hair brush, then dampen with a sponge and give a fourth etching, using the
same precautions as to strength of acid and duration of rocking as before.</p>

<p>Now cool the plate; get a little more ink on the roller, and roll the plate
whilst cold. When the surface of the lines has a nice even coat of ink upon
each and all (coarse and fine), again warm the zinc on the hot plate until it is
just too hot to hold in the fingers; then cool it again, varnish the back with
shellac varnish, then make a mark with a blunt point, in the ink on the
margin, so as to lay a short line of zinc bare to the action of the acid.</p>

<p>The round of operations is repeated; but for rolling up for the fifth and
subsequent etching, a flannel roller is used, and more ink will be required upon
the slab; it will also require to be a little thinner.</p>

<p>For some subjects six or seven etchings will be required, whilst for others—especially
where there are whites that are too small for cutting out with a
fret saw or router—ten or twelve etches will be required. Practice, the best
teacher, will soon enable the operator to judge how many are required.</p>

<p>The etching having been carried as deep as is judged sufficient, sprinkle the
plate liberally with turpentine, and with a stiff scrubbing brush loosen the ink
from the lines, and wash it off with a solution of American potash.</p>

<p>The plate being cleared from all ink, etc., is now examined carefully. The
sides of the lines will show each etching, by a series of irregular steps. If the
plate be put into the press in this condition, the chances are that before many
copies had been made, these steps would take more or less ink from the rollers,
and blur the image; therefore, before passing it into the hands of the printer,
the plate will require etching two or three times more, to get rid of these
irregularities.</p>

<p>This is done by warming the zinc on the hot plate, and then, whilst still
warm, rolling up with a fine glazed roller charged with the hard etching ink
from a clean inking slab.</p>

<p>Roll the zinc firmly, first one way and then the other, so that all the tops of
the lines get well coated with ink; now make a mark on the margin with a
blunt point in the ink, so as to lay a short line of zinc bare to the action of
the acid.</p>

<p>Next empty the etching tray, put into it some clean water, and add sufficient
acid to make it taste like strong vinegar; in this immerse the plate, and keep
rocking for ten or fifteen minutes, or until the mark on the margin, when felt
with the finger-nail, shows that it has attained a depth about the same as that
obtained in the first
etching. <span class="xxpn" id="p061">{61}</span></p>

<p>Now wash the plate under the tap, and wash off the ink with turpentine,
followed by a solution of American potash; again wash and dry on the hot
plate. Now examine, and if the lines are free from the steps, the plate is
finished, but if not, the operation must be repeated until the steps are all
removed.</p>

<p>Be careful to cover the surface of the block thoroughly with the ink, else the
acid will spoil the picture.</p>

<p>The plate is now ready either for mounting for the press, or for electrotypes
being taken from it; if the former, the deep whites are cut away with the
router or fret saw, the edges are trimmed or bevelled, holes are drilled and
counter-sunk at convenient places, for the insertion of nails or screws to fix the
zinc to the wooden block, to make the surface type high.</p>

<p>The object aimed at in the instruction in Part I. is the production of relief
blocks on zinc from an original in black and white, which original may be a
drawing made purposely for reproduction, or it may be from a drawing already
in existence, a woodcut, or engraving, the picture being rendered entirely in
line, or a chalk drawing may be used. In fact, any subject that is capable
of being worked from either at a type press or by ordinary (monochrome)
lithography. Washed drawings, or oil or water color drawings are not
applicable.</p>

<p>In fixing plans, or drawings on the easel, prior to photographing them, if
they are cockled, and difficult to get flat, pins may be placed anywhere, so
long as the lines are not interfered with, for these pins may be painted out
with a camel’s-hair brush and gamboge or Indian ink. It is important that
the plans or drawings be as flat as possible, as if the lines are cockled, they
will not be photographed straight.</p>

<p>In photographing drawings on tracing paper or cloth, a piece of white paper
should be placed behind them.</p>

<p>When, from an original of black lines on a white ground, it is desired to
make a reverse block—<i>i. e.</i>, white lines on a black ground—a negative is first
made from the original, and from that negative a transparency is made; and a
print made upon the zinc from that transparency will be a reverse of the
original.</p>

<p>Thus far I have tried to make plain the details of a process which is as
fascinating and as pretty as any in photography, and which supplies results
which could not be attained by the most expert workers two years ago. And
since those experts first obtained even tolerable results by zinc etching,
like <span class="xxpn" id="p062">{62}</span>
everything else in photography, it has made wonderful progress. At first we
were delighted and content when a block was obtained with relief sufficient to
enable us to print it upon an ordinary press with type. But now we can get
from the zinc surface all the qualities which are given by the lithographic stone.
Indeed, the process of zincography bears a very strong general resemblance to
that of lithography; of course, it varies therefrom in matters of process detail.
The manipulations of zincography, however, are no more complicated in their
nature than the details of printing, etc., from stone. Crayon drawings, ink
work in line and stipple, rubber work, in fact, anything that can be drawn on
stone can be drawn on properly prepared zinc, with the exception of engraved
lines (intaglio), the structure of the zinc not giving the yielding brittleness of
stone. The great departure made possible by zinc plates exists in the fact that
they can be bent to the surface of a cylinder, thus displacing the reciprocating
bed and stop-cylinder of the lithographic press with the continuously rotating
plate and impression cylinder of the zincographic press, which, at the same
driving speed, produces double the number of impressions printed on the lithographic
press. To Mr. Bernard Huber, of the Huber Printing Press Company
of Taunton, Mass., belongs the credit of designing the only American zincographic
press in existence, and which is now in successful operation in several
lithographic establishments. It is a thoroughly American machine in design
and construction, and while no glowing prophecies of its immediately taking the
place of lithographic presses are indulged in, yet this kind of press has its
place and use, and will by its qualities win favor in the trade.</p>

<p>Many lithographers are beginning to give correct attention to zincography,
but few are willing to give the time and constant experimenting to the subject
that has been given by Messrs. Harris &amp; Jones, who during the past three years
have operated the zincographic presses in their lithographic establishment
known as the Providence Lithograph Co. Having taken the selling agency
of the Huber zincographic press, they offer to those who <i>buy</i> the press full
instructions in zincographic surface printing.</p>

<p>These suggestions are given right here, first because we are now about to
take a step higher in zinc etching—a step which will lead us to results which
lithography can scarcely equal in some particulars—and second, because it is
the policy of this work to withhold no information which the novice will need
in supplying himself with a perfect outfit for doing the best of work. For the
same reason the advertisers have been chosen, rather than received in the
usual way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" title="Part II. Photo-engraving in Half-tone."
 id="p063">PART II. <span class="blksmaller">PHOTO-ENGRAVING
 IN HALF-TONE.</span></h2>

<h3 class="nobreak" title="Chapter I. Retrospective.">CHAPTER I.
<span class="blksmaller">RETROSPECTIVE.</span></h3></div>

<p>The former chapters have treated entirely upon the production of blocks in
line—<i>i. e.</i>, where the picture has been made by a draughtsman, the half-tones
and gradations being communicated by a greater or less thickness of line, or by
dots, or stipple, or hatching.</p>

<p>The picture for such blocks may have been specially drawn for the process,
the same size or larger, or it may be a copy of some woodcut or engraving
already in existence, but if it is desired to reproduce blocks from drawings,
paintings, or photographs, then an entirely different method must be adopted,
and the smooth gradations of half-tone levelled, so to speak, so as to bring the
high lights and the shadows upon one plane.</p>

<p>In photographs from nature (or from washed drawings or paintings) the
scale of gradations runs, as it were, in a series of short steps from the deepest
shadow to the highest light, and a block made, say in bichromated gelatine,
from such a negative can give no half-tones, as the inking roller could only
touch the deep shadows properly.</p>

<p>Now the subject of making photographs applicable for the illustration of
letter-press, instead of woodcuts, has occupied the attention of experimentalists
from the early days of the art-science, as the records of the Patent Office show.</p>

<p>The first patent, dated 1852, bears the honored name of Mr. Fox Talbot,
and although it is for intaglio printing, and therefore a little out of place under
the above heading, still it claims our attention as giving a method for breaking
up the half-tones of the photograph, by placing muslin, crape, etc., between the
photographic cliche and the sensitive surface; or a glass plate may be covered
with fine lines, or glass may be coated with powder, which is caused to
adhere. <span class="xxpn" id="p064">{64}</span></p>

<p>In 1854, Paul Pretsch broke up the half-tone by the reticulation of gelatine,
caused by the admixture with iodide of silver and bichromate of potash; this
was spread upon a silvered copper plate, dried, and exposed to light under the
half-tone negative, then washed in cold water and borax, or carbonate of soda,
then in alcohol, coated with copal varnish, and immersed in a weak solution of
tannin, after which an electrotype could be made, or a transfer made to zinc
or stone.</p>

<p>In 1855, A. J. Berchtold produced a grain by printing upon a photograph
in black or in any color, from a plate or block or other surface, or by perforating
or making strokes, lines, or dots upon it, by roller or other instrument.
Repatented in 1883, by Brown, Barnes, and Bell.</p>

<p>In 1860, E. J. Asser used starch, and in 1865, J. W. Swan used a tissue
of gelatine mixed with charcoal or other chemically inert grit; in the same
year Messrs. E. &amp; J. Bullock published, perhaps, the most important specification,
describing all, or nearly all, practical methods of obtaining grain, the most
important of which are the placing of any fine fabric between the lens and the
sensitive surface, or between the camera and the object, or copies of granulated
or recticulated structures or fabrics could be used, or such copy could be placed
in contact with negatives, and both copied together.</p>

<p>In 1879, J. W. Swan made negatives by moving, during exposure, the
Bullock’s screen, placed in front of a sensitive plate. Meisenbach’s method,
patented a little later, is somewhat similar.</p>

<p>If a Woodbury relief is thinly coated with transfer ink, and then laid upon
a piece of ordinary litho transfer paper which has been embossed with lines, or
dots, or stipple, by being pressed in contact with wire gauze or an engraved
plate, and the inked relief and the embossed litho transfer are then subjected to
heavy pressure, a grained image is impressed upon the transfer paper, which
can be transferred to zinc, and then etched in relief.</p>

<p>The method of making a grained negative to be now described, shortly
stated, is done by interposing a screen, either before the sensitive plate in the
dark slide of the camera (when copying a photograph) or placing the screen
behind a transparency on glass when transmitted light is used. In the first
instance the image projected upon the sensitive plate, having first to pass
through the screen, is broken up by the dots upon the screen, the result being a
definite grained negative. In the second instance, the screen being placed in
contact with the transparency, a similar result follows. The first method is
most generally used, as the print does not require the careful focussing necessitated
by the second.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="p065"
 title="Chapter II. Making Grained Negatives.">
CHAPTER II. <span class="blksmaller">MAKING GRAINED NEGATIVES.</span></h3></div>

<h4 title="The Screen.">THE SCREEN.</h4>

<p>For making grained negatives, the apparatus, chemicals, and manipulations
described in Chapters I. and II., Part I., for line negatives, are required, with
perhaps a little increased care to secure clean and bright negatives.</p>

<p>The first requirement will be a proof, on fine white paper, from a machine-ruled
plate, or a plate with fine dots or stipple; a favorite being plates ruled
diagonally and straight, either in single lines or crossed. These plates must be
of good size, say 18 by 15, ruled with lines as fine as possible, 100 or 150 to
the inch. The ruled sheet must be perfect, as any defect in it will be fatal.</p>

<p>Such a proof being secured, it should be carefully mounted with starch paste
upon a stout piece of smooth cardboard, and should be carefully shielded
from all chances of being soiled, as the slightest stain or mark upon it will
unfit it for use. As such a fine line is very difficult to focus, especially in
making the smaller screens, it will be found a good plan to cut four narrow
strips of good, bold type, and paste these at the four corners of the sheet, just
outside the ruling; these slips of type will be easy to focus, and will render the
task of making the screens easier.</p>

<p>Plates ruled with single lines, either diagonally or horizontally, may be used
instead of the cross ruling, and are by many preferred.</p>

<p>Those in possession of a ruling machine may make these ruled sheets by
ruling a large litho stone, and pulling impressions from that stone. If this is
done once, and done well, the sheets will last a lifetime; and if the stone be
sufficiently large, and the lines very fine, the screens may be used for blocks
15 by 12 inches or larger.</p>

<p>To copy this ruled sheet, remove the mirror from the lens, and put the lens
in the camera in its ordinary position; then pin up the sheet on the easel, and,
after seeing that the easel and camera are quite parallel, proceed to make a
series of negatives from the sheet, making screens of various degrees of fineness,
varying from a coarse grain for a coarse photograph, to the finest possible
for <span class="xxpn" id="p066">{66}</span>
photographs full of delicate half-tone, and from three inches to ten inches wide.
Many subjects will need screens made especially for them. The screens must
be free from speck or stain, and should be made upon very thin glass.</p>

<p>The nitrate bath should be in good condition, and the collodion ripe. Such
negatives take a good deal of time making, but as they are the foundation of
the process, and with care will last for years, the trouble must not be grudged.</p>

<p>The screen negatives being made, they must be varnished with a good, hard,
well-filtered varnish, applied in a room quite free from dust.</p>

<p>The screens must be made by the wet collodion process. The ordinary
gelatine dry-plate is utterly useless for such work. Gelatino-chloride plates
might do, but the exposure is so very long that there is risk of shaking the
camera during exposure.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="The Grained Negative.">THE GRAINED NEGATIVE.</h4>

<p>For the first method a good vigorous photograph is selected, placed in position
on a copying board, and the camera adjusted so as to get the image on the
focussing screen the size wanted the mirror being used, as the negative must
be reversed.</p></div>

<p>A collodion plate is now prepared and well drained; then one of the transparent
screens is fixed in front of the carrier by drawing pins, by passing strips
of gum paper over, or by fixing with fine tacks a piece of thin card at the top,
and one at the bottom, slightly overlapping the screen, and holding it firmly in
a sort of rebate.</p>

<p>The carrier is now placed in the dark slide, the sensitive plate in its place,
the door of the slide closed and fastened.</p>

<p>The exposure is now made in the camera, and if the screen is properly
transparent the time will not be very much more than when copying in the
ordinary way.</p>

<p>The development of the exposed plate is done by means of the developer
given in Chapter I., and the result must have all the details of the photograph,
while the lines of the screen must be clear and free from veil.</p>

<p>The negative is washed, fixed in cyanide, washed again and then intensified,
first immersing it in the solution No. 1, Chapter I., until bleached, then thoroughly
washed and blacked with No. 2 solution, again washed, and varnished
with the water varnish, or dried and varnished with benzole varnish.</p>

<p>For the second method we shall require, instead of a paper photograph, a
transparency on
glass. <span class="xxpn" id="p067">{67}</span></p>

<p>The transparency may be made on a gelatine dry-plate by printing in
contact with the negative, or an enlarged transparency may be made, either on
a dry plate or by the wet collodion process.</p>

<p>The transparency should be made by contact, when the original negative is
of larger size than the block required; the enlarged transparency is used if
the negative be smaller or the same size as the block.</p>

<p>The development of the transparencies on gelatine dry-plates will be treated
of later, but if wet collodion be used, the manipulations will be the same
as for negatives, except that the image is in reverse gradations, the lights
being clear glass, and the shades
dense and black. Every detail
in lights, shadows, and half-tones
must show distinct and strong.</p>

<div class="figright imwth06" id="fig05">
<img src="images/i067.jpg" width="312" height="318" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 5.</div>
</div>

<p>For the production of these
enlarged transparencies, an enlarging
camera will be required, which
may be provided by having an
arrangement in front of the ordinary
camera, fitted like the accompanying
figure, consisting of two
boxes, one sliding within the
other, the negative from which
the transparency is to be made
being placed in a carrier at B.</p>

<p>In the illustration the sides are
shown open, but only for simplicity,
as they must be quite opaque. In using such an arrangement, the
camera must be brought under the skylight of the studio, and the light reflected
through the negative, by placing a large sheet of white paper at an angle of
forty-five degrees in front of the negative.</p>

<p>Another and perhaps better method will be to cut a hole in a dark-room
at a proper height for the camera, and fix the negative in the hole, then adjust
the focus upon the screen, illuminating the negative by means of a reflector
fixed at an angle of forty-five degrees.</p>

<p>The transparency being secured, it is varnished, and all blemishes or spots
removed by means of a sable brush, and a little carmine color; it is then
placed in contact with a suitable screen, and the two together are inserted in
the <span class="xxpn" id="p068">{68}</span>
place previously occupied by the original negative. Now adjust the camera so
as to get the image on the focussing screen the proper size, and proceed to
make a grained negative by the wet collodion process exactly as described in
Chapter II., Part I., and above. When a negative containing all the details
of the original negative broken up by the fine grain of the screen is obtained,
it may be dried and varnished, and then it is ready for printing upon the zinc.</p>

<p>All pinholes, etc., should be stopped by means of a fine sable brush and
Indian ink. The printing on the zinc should be done by the bitumen process,
Chapter VI., Part I., as the albumen is not nearly so perfect. If, however, the
albumen process be preferred, the printing is done in the same way as described
in Chapter V., but extra care must be taken, first, that the zinc plate is thoroughly
and evenly polished; secondly, that the graining bath is kept weak with
plenty of alum in, so as to have the grain on the plate as fine as possible;
thirdly, that no speck of dust, dirt, or any air-bubbles be on the film after
coating, and that the whirling be effectually done so as to get the sensitive
coating as even as possible.</p>

<p>The inking up requires no comment, as it must be done as evenly and thinly
as possible, for both line and half-tone.</p>

<p>In development, a little more energetic friction will be necessary, but extreme
care must be taken not to abrade the ink surface. Continue the rubbing
until all the details are developed, and bear in mind that the finished block
will be exactly like the zinc after development.</p>

<p>In printing these half-tone zincs, it often happens (like printing in silver)
that to get the best results some portions will require less exposure than others.
The best way to stop back any portion or portions, is to cover the front glass
of the printing frame with whiting mixed with water to the consistency of thick
cream; apply with a rag over the places in the negative, before exposing to
light, and at the end of one-third, or in case of very deep shades, one-half the
exposure, clean off the whiting and finish the exposure without any obstruction
to the light.</p>

<p>The exposure to a grained half-tone negative will be one-half to double as
long as a simple line negative.</p>

<p>A perfect print on the zinc must contain all the grain intact, for if there is
any break in its continuity, it is of no use to proceed further with it.</p>

<p>The printing in bitumen requires no more comment than to say care is
necessary to avoid dust. The smallest speck will be likely to spoil an otherwise
perfect print.</p>

<p>The zinc plate with the image upon it in ink, is dried, then warmed slightly
on the hot plate, cooled, and coated with thick gum* and fanned dry (not dried
by heat, or the gum is certain to crack and bring away the image or part of
it); then wash it under the tap, and rub it gently with a fine sponge so as to
remove all gum from the ink, but not from the zinc. Next proceed to roll up
as directed in Chapter V., using the India-rubber roller charged with stiff ink.
The surface of the zinc should be kept well covered with water. Use as little
pressure as possible, but let the motion be fairly rapid, and if any portions of
the image should smear, roll rapidly with slightly increased pressure.</p>

<div class="footnote" id="Footnote_2_2">
<p class="pfn">* See page
<a href="#p055" title="go to p. 55">55,</a> Part I., Gum and Nut-galls.</p></div>

<p>This operation of rolling up the image is the crucial one, for unless it is
done properly, when it is finished, the result is a strong black and perfectly
even image; it is of no use proceeding further with it, for in fact the picture
must be perfect.</p>

<p>The rolling up being done, any touching up that may be required can now
be done, and any fine details clouded over, or made indistinct by the grain,
strengthened or opened out. Additions should be made with transfer ink
thinned with turpentine, laid on with a very fine sable brush. The whites are
put in by scratching through the ink with a fine etching needle.</p>

<p>To rest the hand upon in doing this touching up, so as to avoid touching
the image, a bridge is used made of a strip of smooth wood, one inch wide,
quarter of an inch thick, and sufficiently long to well span the plate; at each
end of this strip nail narrow strips a quarter of an inch thick to serve as the
feet for the bridge to stand upon. Then the zinc may be slid under it
without touching the surface against the under part of the bridge.</p>

<p>The zinc is now ready for the first etching in the rocking tray. The nitric
acid solution must be very weak indeed to the taste, the presence of acid being
just perceptible. The time of immersion in the first bath must not
be longer <span class="xxpn" id="p070">{70}</span>
than thirty seconds; then the zinc is removed, washed under the tap, and
gently rubbed with a sponge; dry it gently on the hot plate, allow the zinc to
cool, coat it with gum, fan it dry, rinse it under the tap and rub it with a sponge;
then again roll up, when it is ready for the second etching; that is done in the
same bath as the first, without any addition of acid. Keep the tray gently
rocking for three minutes, then again withdraw, wash it under the tap, rubbing
with sponge, coat with gum, fan dry, wash under the tap rubbing gently with
sponge, and again roll up, using the ink on the roller a little thicker, but stiff.
When the image has taken the ink equally, place it on the hot plate and allow
the zinc to get hot enough to melt the ink slightly; then allow it to cool, and
place it in the etching bath, slightly reinforced with a few drops of nitric acid.
Immerse it this time for five minutes.</p>

<p>The operations of washing, gumming, rolling up, etc., are to be repeated
until it is judged that the etching has been carried far enough. The time of
immersion in the acid solution with each etching may be lengthened, but take
special care to keep the bath weak until near the last etching, when the strength
may be slightly increased.</p>

<p>The resist is cleaned off with turpentine and a stiff brush, and then a proof
is pulled. If further etching will improve it wholly or in part, the plate is
inked up and again subjected to the action of the acid bath.</p>

<p>If only portions require reëtching, cover the rest with bitumen varnish; but
it will be scarcely safe to give more than one etching after cleaning off the
original resist.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="When The Image Is In Bitumen.">WHEN THE IMAGE IS IN BITUMEN.</h4>

<p>A bitumen image is etched in the first bath in which the acid is just perceptible
to the taste, without any preliminary rolling up. The duration of the
first etching may be prolonged for three or five minutes; then the plate is withdrawn
and well washed. Remove any scum with a soft sponge; then dry it in
a cold current, and smear it with gum, fan it dry, and roll up with a leather
roller charged with stiff ink, until all portions of the image have taken a film
of ink. Now reinforce the nitrate bath with a few drops of nitric acid, and
again immerse the plate, rocking the bath for ten minutes; watch the picture
carefully so that in case of undercutting the plate may be removed before any
mischief is done.</p></div>

<p>The plate is again removed, washed, rubbed with a sponge, and dried; it
is <span class="xxpn" id="p071">{71}</span>
then warmed on the hot plate, so as to slightly melt the ink, then allowed to
cool, smeared with gum, fanned dry, damped over with a wet sponge, and
rolled up, the roller being charged with stiff ink. The plate is now ready for
another etching, for which the bath must be strengthened by the addition of
more acid. The immersion (rocking all the time) may be fifteen or twenty
minutes, after which the plate is withdrawn, washed, rubbed with a sponge,
and if it is thought another etching would improve it, the cycle of operations
is repeated, beginning with warming the zinc on the hot plate.</p>

<p>After the resist is cleaned off (which with bitumen must be done first with
turpentine and then with benzoline) further etching may be given, if deemed
necessary, first inking up well with the hard ink mentioned in Chapter VIII.,
and then reimmersing in a weak bath of acid and water. If only a portion
requires reëtching, those parts that are not to be touched, are protected by
coating with bitumen varnish.</p>

<p>The plate being etched, now requires finishing.</p>

<p>The outside zinc is removed with a circular saw and then the edges are filed
and holes drilled at an angle, so that the metal can be fixed upon the
block.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="p072"
 title="Chapter IV. Printing from the Block.">
 CHAPTER IV. <span class="blksmaller">PRINTING
 FROM THE BLOCK.</span></h3></div>

<p>A half-tone block to give results commensurate with the care needed in its
preparation, must be handled by the machine man with care and consideration.</p>

<p>The blanket on the tympan or cylinder must be replaced with something
harder, else the soft pressure of the blanket will blur the print.</p>

<p>The block must also be made ready, not by putting cut-outs on the tympan
or cylinder, but underneath the block, and there as thin as possible.</p>

<p>The ink must be good and not too thin; the rollers must be free from flaws
and not too tacky. In fact, as much care is required on the press as during the
photographic and subsequent operations. Indeed photo-engraving and zinc
etching would have come into popular use more rapidly than they have, if
printers had been willing to give them the special “making-ready” attention
they require. Despite all prejudice and indifference, “process-engraving” so
called, has made continuous improvement ever since it came into use, and the
good work goes on. The most delicate gradations of light and shade discernible
in nature, may, from the photographic plate, be rendered in pure black and
white by means of any of the methods given in this work. All that nature
displays, and all that imagination compels, may be reproduced indefinitely.</p>

<p>With regard to the storage and keeping of zinc blocks after using, Mr. T.
Bolas, in the <i>Photographic News</i> of September 24, 1886, says, “they should not
be washed with the usual lye, but should have a few drops of paraffine oil poured
upon them; and after this has been well rubbed in by a soft brush kept for the
purpose, the paraffine should be well wiped away with a soft cloth. If the
block is to be stored away for a long time, it should be waxed. The best
way of doing this will be to make it rather warmer than is necessary to melt
wax, and then to rub it over with a piece of yellow bees’-wax, after which the
excess is wiped off with a piece of flannel.”</p>

<p>Sometimes zinc blocks are electroplated with copper or nickel (a necessity
when they are to be used for certain color work), and such blocks should also
be treated in the same way as the bare zinc, as they cannot be safely cleaned
with the lye solution.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="p073" title="Chapter V. The
Transfer of the Drawing, and Its Treatment Before
Etching.">CHAPTER V.
<span class="blksmaller">THE TRANSFER OF
THE DRAWING, AND ITS TREATMENT BEFORE
ETCHING.</span></h3></div>

<p>According to the methods of producing them, classify the drawings as
follows:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Freehand drawings in crayon or ink, drawn with lithographical chalk
on rough paper, or with pen and chemical Indian ink on paper prepared for
transferring.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Lithographical transfer of engravings, pen-and-ink crayon drawings,
or drawings on stone.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Transfers from relief plates made in copper, steel, zinc, or lead (music).</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Anastatic transfers.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Fat or resin prints from photographic negatives.</p>

<p>Proceed as follows:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Transfer of hand-drawing.</i>—Place the drawing to be transferred with its
face upon a sheet of clean, white paper, and moisten the back with a weak
solution of nitric acid
(<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#8260;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>&#xfeff;°&nbsp;Baumé),
by means of a sponge. Over-moistening
causes obliteration of the drawing, fringing of the single lines, and the running
together of the hatched portions. The correct degree of moisture can be ascertained
when the side prepared and drawn upon grows slightly sticky, and when
the drawing becomes glossy. This will take place in from four to five minutes
after moistening. This time is to be spent in arranging the zinc in the press,
after having freed it from all greasiness. Place a card on the rolling press
below the drawing and the zinc; above it, a sheet of good blotting-paper, a
sheet of Bristol paper and are of pressing board; then make a trial print with
the press, a clean piece of paper taking the place of the drawing. The correct
pressure is a matter of experience; it is advisable to begin with a pressure less
by one sheet, in order to be able to increase it during the process of transfer.</p>

<p>In the lithographic press the ink-block is first to be adjusted; since it needs
a greater “setting in” than the rolling press, the zinc must be cut larger. It
must extend three centimetres on all sides beyond the drawing. The edges of
the cut plate must be well ground off, in order that the ink-block may not
be <span class="xxpn" id="p074">{74}</span>
caught; at all events, it is advisable to have the latter smaller than the plate.
Observe that the range of the press should be regulated; then place the zinc
directly, without any intervening layer of paper, on a solid stone; lay upon it
a clean sheet of paper, a blotter, a sheet of Bristol paper, and a pressing board
well covered with tallow. Make a trial by drawing the sheet through at a
moderate pressure. If all is arranged, the work of transfer can be started.
The temperature of the zinc should now be about 35°&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>Place the drawing down carefully, without moving it about; upon it the
blotter, the Bristol paper, and a pressing board, and draw it through three
times with constantly increasing pressure; turn the plate in a contrary direction,
and draw it through three times in the same manner. Now place a moistened
sheet of good paper between the blotter and the drawing, and draw through,
first with weak, and then with strong pressure, three times in both positions.
Instead of turning the zinc, the ink-block may be reversed. This finishes the
operation of transprinting, and the next question is the loosening of the paper
from the zinc. Here we can pursue two methods: first, we can have hot water
and a porcelain tray at hand; place the copied plate in the tray, and pour the
water upon it. The coated layer bearing the drawing begins to separate from
the paper. Shaking the tray promotes this action, and soon the paper will
loosen itself from the layer which remains attached to the zinc. With the
second method proceed thus: moisten the back of the copied drawing, thoroughly
with a sponge and cold water; allow it to soak in, warm the plate to
60°–65°&nbsp;C. and carefully rub all parts by hand. The layer will again separate
by degrees from the paper, which latter we can then easily lift off from the
plate.</p>

<p>On account of the strongly gelatinous layer, crayons on grained paper should
only be moistened moderately before and after the first rolling, in order to avoid
the coiling of the paper.</p>

<p>Hand-drawings on paper without coloring require treatment with stronger
acid (I recommend nitric acid, 4°&nbsp;Beaumé). At the same time the drawing
should be cut as close as possible. To draw it through securely, place it as
usual upon the zinc, and above it a piece of prepared copy paper moderately
moistened, and a trifle larger than the drawing, then a blotter, a Bristol board,
and a thick card, and draw through as before. The coated copy paper sticks
tight to the zinc after the first rolling; it also retains the drawing in its first
position, and allows repeated rolling. If the original was over-moist
when <span class="xxpn" id="p075">{75}</span>
copying, it sticks to the zinc and separates with difficulty; if the moistening
was just right, two perfect copies can often be made from the same original.</p>

<p>I have attempted to copy drawings on a fatty zinc surface, and to etch them
strongly, but, far from being satisfied with the result, I prefer the above
method.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i> and <i>c</i>) Copies of lithographs, type, plates for printing of any kind, plates
for <i>deep</i> printing, I make on well satinized copying paper*; in making the
prints, I employ a copying ink as thick as possible, with the addition of a few
drops of a thick solution of asphaltum in lavender oil, rolling a long time with
but little color, so as to get a sharp rather than a heavy print.</p>

<div class="footnote" id="Footnote_3_3">
<p class="pfn">* Instead of the paste-gelatine-chalk, I prefer to prepare
the surface with a decoction of semina psyllii.</p></div>

<p>Plates for <i>deep</i> printing, I heat equally throughout before applying the color.
Instead of color, I rub them with chemical Indian ink, wipe the surface carefully,
even polish it finally with a ball and some Frankfort black. I then
draw it through and again heat it uniformly, so that the copy comes off of
itself. Fine, sharp transfers, with perfect relief, are thus obtained.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Anastatic copies are no longer of great value, since they always turn out
roughly and cannot compare with photographic copies. Although I possess a
safe method, I believe that I will have to omit it on account of the limited
space of my work and the minute importance of the results.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Photographic fat or resin prints should be treated like ordinary prints.
Moisten them on the back with water—which is preferable to placing them
between moistened blotting-paper, since the drawing does not grow too wet—and
wait till they are easily flexible. Drops of water on the film can and often
do destroy the proof. Draw the plate through with increasing pressure and
one intermediate moistening. Prints in fatty inks necessitate a temperature of
plate of 35°&nbsp;C. Prints with dissolved etching varnish (resin) as a printing
film should have from 50°–60°&nbsp;C. When loosening the paper avoid warming,
but moisten well. Sticking of the gelatine film happens, especially with
Husnik’s paper; a safe remedy is to dry the copy in strong light, after developing.
Old sensitized paper, on the contrary, seldom sticks at all, and
fresh paper should always be sought.</p>

<p>In printing with the rolling press, I observe that the rollers of the press
need only once to be regulated, and that greater or less pressure can be attained
by thicker or thinner covering of the print with sheets of paper. This gives
much greater security than can be had when constantly readjusting
the rollers. <span class="xxpn" id="p076">{76}</span></p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="The Further Treatment Of The Transfer.">THE
 FURTHER TREATMENT OF THE TRANSFER.</h4>

<p>Should we now proceed directly to etch the copy, the acid would act through
the drawing, which is as yet but loosely attached to the zinc, and would at last
cause the lines to appear broken, if not destroy them.</p></div>

<p>It is, therefore, necessary to replace the loose copy by a possibly dense
etching varnish, attached fast to the zinc, and to produce an intimate connection
between the latter and the etching varnish. Here we meet a difference between
the French and Austrian methods. The former, totally based on the lithographic
process, favors the use of a resinous dense color as a <i>strengthening
material</i>, whereas the Austrian method employs an ordinary copying color and
endeavors to form an etching varnish by sprinkling and melting in a quantity
of finely pulverized resin. In the method of etching with copper sulphate, it
was attempted to restrict the corroding action of the sulphuric acid by the
following method: The drawing, rubbed with color and thinly besprinkled
with resin, was slightly melted in, then sprinkled and rubbed with the finest
silver graphite or real water-gold. It was thus made an electric conductor.
A thin coating of copper was then deposited on the drawing, which, in point of
fact, hindered the destruction of the film. At the same time, however, the
process became uncontrollable, since often a deposit of amorphous copper
became tightly fastened to the metallic surface. The lateral action could not
well be ascertained, since the narrowest parts were often clogged with metal,
without preventing corrosion from below.</p>

<p>The French method of etching is this: A thick solution of gum-arabic is
mixed with extract of nutgalls; this is carefully spread over the surface of the
plate by means of a fine sponge, and dried by a fan. Then a knife’s point full
of etching color (composed of 500 grammes chalk color, 40 grammes coagulated
mutton suet, 40 grammes soap, 125 grammes yellow wax, 40 grammes margarin,
and 40 grammes oleine, melted in the warm bath and passed through the color
mill) is dissolved in oil of turpentine, and a portion of this solution is spread
uniformly on the grinding stone by means of a fine sponge, so that the latter
contains a similar layer of color throughout. The fatty gum film is then
washed, with a wet sponge, free from fat and acid; a fresh quantity of the
gum and nutgall solution is poured out, and the copy is by degrees strengthened
by rubbing on the etching color with a sponge. This is repeated until the
drawing has attained the proper strength throughout. The superposed layer
of gum is then washed off, the superfluous water is removed with a sponge, a
wet cloth, and blotting-paper, dried with a fan, then gently
warmed. <span class="xxpn" id="p077">{77}</span></p>

<p>Now the plate is to be dusted with the finest pulverized resin, consisting of
equal parts of Syrian asphalt, washed in alcohol, and of mastic; the superfluous
resin is removed with a brush and some cotton; the plate is then carefully
heated, without beginning to melt the resin, however.</p>

<p>This, by the French method, finishes the plate for etching. Only weak acid
is safe for such a plate, however.</p>

<p>According to the Austrian method (practised by me for several years), we
proceed as follows: The copied plate is first copiously coated with a cold
saturated solution of gallic acid, and then with a pure solution of gum.
Without allowing it to dry, I remove the superfluous preparing materials with
a wet sponge, and pour on some fresh gallic acid, as with an excess of acid the
drawing assumes a more brilliant black color.</p>

<p>The strengthening with ordinary copying color I effect, as the case may be,
with the rollers, the sponge, or by coating.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Strengthening with the Rollers.</i>—I roll out some thick copying ink with
good, rough rollers which have been frequently used, and begin to roll the
transfer plate while still damp, without any pressure, till its surface begins to
dry. I then grasp the handles of the rollers more firmly and blacken the dry
plate uniformly, giving it a thin coat of ink. This done, I moisten it a little
and roll it regularly with rollers freshly treated with color, so that the picture
comes up harmoniously and strongly.</p>

<p>Rolling off during drying keeps the gum solution from the drawing while
drying on, and keeps open the connection for rolling in.</p>

<p>Before going further I will explain the terms used*: To roll in is to give
color or ink, and is done slowly, with tightly grasped handles and certain pressure.
Rolling off is effected with loosely grasped handles, without pressure, and
quickly, and is intended to draw off with the rollers any excess of color on the
plate. <i>To work out</i> or <i>make the rollers</i> means to bring fresh color on it from
the grinding stone, and is done with strong pressure and strong traction. The
correct management of the rollers rests in the wrists. To <i>reverse the rollers</i>, to
<i>change the handles</i>, means to turn the rollers around, to make the left-hand
handle the right-hand one, and thus to correct irregularities in the distribution
of color. After every advance and return on the stone or plate to be blackened
the rollers are newly adjusted. The plate thus strengthened
must be well <span class="xxpn" id="p078">{78}</span>
washed with clear water, to be dried, and at times even to be retouched with a
brush and color dissolved in oil of turpentine.</p>

<div class="footnote" id="Footnote_4_4">
<p class="pfn">* Color and ink are synonymous. “Burn in” and “melt in”
mean the same.</p></div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Blackening in</i> with a sponge. The initiatory etching is done with gallic
acid, the gum coating put on and additional gallic acid poured over; then some
turpentine solution of copy color, the consistency of syrup, is rubbed over the
plate until the picture is uniformly strengthened. If, as may happen in hand-drawings,
the color should become massed and not attach itself smoothly, it
must be washed off with turpentine and then clean color must be rubbed on.</p>

<p>This operation requires great delicacy. After having finished the blackening
in, rinse well, dry with a sponge and thick blotting paper. Heat, so as to
vaporize the last remnants of dampness, and retouch.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) A peculiar method of strengthening, nowhere described, as far as I know,
is that of drying the plate after coating it with gum, then washing the gum
with water; then, after drying, of covering the plate with a thin solution of
wax, asphaltum, rosin, and shellac in ether, and of carefully coating the quickly
drying film with gum. The film remains on the lines of the copy, but easily
detaches itself from the bright metallic spaces, which have an insoluble combination
with the gallic acid and gum, and are thus protected from the fat.</p>

<p><i>Faults in strengthening</i> are caused by the following:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> By ink which is too thick or too thin, or which has not been well ground.
Stripes are caused by the dissolving of the color which is already present.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> By excessive dampness on the plate (it does not take the color; the color
in the sponge changes to a slimy emulsion).</p>

<p><i>c.</i> By too great pressure with the color sponge the fine parts are lost. The
same is the case with careless washing of the color of hand-drawings.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> In <i>rolling on</i> excessive moisture on the plate spoils the work. The surface
of the rollers becomes glossy and must be again inked.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> In pouring out the ink a very thick layer prevents the strengthening of
the finest lines.</p>

<p>Dirt on the plate often comes from handling the drawings; it must be
scratched off and the plate must be perfect before proceeding.</p>

<p>Now comes the changing of the ink into an etching varnish. But before
beginning we must cover the free edges of the zinc for the distance of half a
centimetre around the drawing with a solution of ink in turpentine; the same
applies to large white surfaces in the drawing, which it is more convenient to
cut out with a scroll saw. Then subject the plate to the finest
asphaltum <span class="xxpn" id="p079">{79}</span>
powder, passed through a hair-sieve, and cover it by the dusting brush copiously
with powdered rosin. Continue the rubbing on of fresh powder for a minute,
until the ink is saturated, then dust out the superfluous powder with the dusting
brush and fine cotton, so that the metal is bright (no film should be perceptible
on looking over it).</p>

<p>The plate should now be heated to about 60°&nbsp;C., till the color of the
asphaltum changes from a coffee tint to a dead (matt) black. Place the plate
in this condition a second time with the asphaltum, which is again absorbed
rapidly. Dust off carefully as before and burn in again till the color changes
to a somewhat shiny black; the yellow tint must be avoided, because this
degree of burning exposes the lights in the closest hatchings to the danger of
running together.</p>

<p>Thus the coat of color is changed into an etching varnish of excellent resistance
and adhesion, and the plate is ready for etching.</p>

determine a plane for the closest hatchings; in a uniformly deep layer the lines
lie at a moderate distance apart, and those of the highest lights are very deep.
These three planes are situated higher or lower according to the very narrow
or very wide series of lines. This gives a natural division of the different
stages of etching, and, according to the three depths, we distinguish the <i>sharp
etching</i> or <i>etching on</i> in which the engraving must advance far enough to place
the narrowest portions sufficiently low; <i>middle etching</i>, which has to accomplish
the same for the moderately narrow portions, and <i>deep etching</i>, which must
attain sufficient depth for the highest lights.</p></div>

<p>On account of the lateral action of the acid it is impossible to etch down
perpendicularly, but a wider covering is taken for each stage. Of these wider
coverings there remain after etching all around the relief two terrace like
grades, which must also be removed.</p>

<p>We have, then, in addition to the above, three sorts of etching, a <i>round etching</i>,
in which the grade remaining from the deep etching is to be removed, and a
<i>clean etching</i>, or a removal of the wire-edge left after middle etching.</p>

<p>This natural subdivision is found in the old French method as well as in
the <span class="xxpn" id="p080">{80}</span>
new method, and both coating and the acids are of a strength proportionate to
the different stages of the work.</p>

<p>We have already alluded to the lateral action of the acid; it is a factor that
taxes the care of the etcher in the highest degree. In the beginning of the
action of the acid, the edge of the metal under the coating is exposed the more,
the longer the action lasts; here, of course, the dissolving power becomes apparent.
The deeper we go, the more the metal under the line is exposed, and
the action on the lateral edge continually increases. In the effect of the acid
we distinguish thence, a perpendicular and a lateral action. Since the latter
cannot be removed by changing the character of the acid, we must give it a
part in this process of dissolving metals, but at the same time must invent a
method which will prevent the lines from growing thin.</p>

<p>But in order to do this we must know the relation of the perpendicular to
side action. Both are in proportion, a result both of theoretical and practical
consideration. In order then to attain a certain depth of etching, a proportional
lateral protection must take place, which is by degrees destroyed by the lateral
action. Since this lateral action sets in at the beginning of the work, the
dimension of the line must be secured from the start. This is done in the
Vienna method by the already mentioned formation of the etching varnish, by
means of dusting with resin and burning in, by which an almost imperceptible
growing of the width of line is attained. The French method endeavors to
correct this by using a very weak acid and a correspondingly thin coating, but
coating oftener and etching at every new coating, as we shall see below. Also
the coating for middle and deep etching must be arranged in accordance with
the principles above elucidated. As deep as the middle or deep etching is
desired, so wide must the lines be surrounded by etching varnish.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Etching By The French Method.">ETCHING BY THE FRENCH METHOD.</h4>

<p>We have already seen (p. <a href="#p076" title="go to p. 76">76</a>) how a copy is made by the French method
for etching, and we now continue the development of this process.</p></div>

<p>Into a tray pour 4 litres of water at 18°&nbsp;C., add 15 c.cm. nitric acid and
mix well by shaking. Then place the prepared plate into the bath and rock
it for seven or ten minutes (according to the fineness of the drawing), rinse
well with water, remove the remaining water with blotting paper, and, finally,
dry thoroughly with a fan. (Do not forget to dry the back.) Now warm the
plate from the back, moving the flame about continually, so as to secure uniform
heating and prevent warping of the zinc. The asphalt powder, which is
as <span class="xxpn" id="p081">{81}</span>
yet but loosely attached, is more intimately connected with the subjacent ink
through this heating process. The combination becomes evident from the
assumption of a black lustre. With the appearance of this, stop heating, and
lay the plate on a cold stone to cool. This done, spread some gallic acid over
it with a soft sponge, and without washing it off, spread gum on the surface of
the plate, and hasten the drying with a fan.</p>

<p>Mix some etching ink with varnish and work it out into a thin layer with
good rough rollers. If the rollers are in order, wash the coat of gallic acid
and gum from the plate, remove superfluous water and <i>roll in</i> (the manner
similar to that used in lithography). The surface of the plate should not be
more than moderately damp, so that the rollers may not slip. If a coat of
color has been uniformly deposited, wash the plate with clean water, remove
the excess with a sponge and blotter, dry by fan and remove all moisture by
heating to 45°&nbsp;C. Dust the warm plate again with asphaltum (remove the
excess), and warm it a trifle to secure better adherence. Strengthen the bath by
the addition of 15 c.cm. nitric acid, and etch again for seven or ten minutes
under continued shaking. Then rinse the plate, remove the water and dry
with a fan, and burn in the resin powder well. Careful inspection will now
show a successful and uniform but still weak relief.</p>

<p>As before, the plate is coated with gallic acid and solution of gum, is dried,
washed, and <i>blackened in</i>, in which treatment one-third “wax
pomatum”* is
mixed with the etching ink. After washing and drying heat the plate up to
60°&nbsp;C., thus causing an imperceptible widening of the drawing. After coating
dust once more with asphaltum, warm it and cover only the back and the
white rim around the drawing with a solution of shellac (1 part ruby shellac
in 10 parts spirits). Strengthen the bath with 20 c.cm. of acid and bathe it
for seven to ten minutes, shaking the bath regularly. Continue until you see
that the lateral action of the acid has almost wholly destroyed the lateral
covering produced by heating. Do not, however, etch too long, and do not
mistake the <i>over</i>-hanging coat for the other. Then follow washing, drying,
melting on some resin, cooling, coating with gum, blacking in with equal parts
of etching ink and “wax pomatum,” then washing, drying, greater heating
(70°&nbsp;C.) (so that by increasing the ink each line receives lateral protection),
cool and dust to excess with the finest resin dust.
<span class="xxpn" id="p082">{82}</span></p>

<div class="footnote" id="Footnote_5_5">
<p class="pfn">* Wax pomatum is prepared by cutting beeswax into
fine parts and covering it in a wide-necked flask with oil of
turpentine. In a few days a jelly-like mixture will remain, which
serves the above purpose.</p></div>

<p>As we have now reached the necessary depth for the narrowest portions, we
use, instead of the asphaltum, resin, which melts easily and spreads out readily,
in order to attain protection for our middle etching.</p>

<p>Strengthen the bath with 30 c.cm. acid, and bathe until the lateral action of
the acid has reduced the lateral coating to a narrow edge. Then wash, dry,
melt on some resin, cool, prepare with gum. Blacken in as before, but employ
one-third etching ink and two-thirds wax pomade and apply so thickly that all
the narrowest spaces of the drawing are completely filled with color. Continue
warming until the ink, which was applied, has well covered each line; then
dry and use resin as before.</p>

<p>The acid may now be strengthened by 100–158 c.cm., according to the
strength of coating chosen. Bathing must be continued until the edge that
has run off begins to grow narrow. Wash, dry, burn in resin, cool, coat with
gum, and blacken in by rollers with clean wax. Continue heating until each
line is well covered by ink. Always dust until the ink is fully saturated and
then heat gently.</p>

<p>Strengthen the bath 200 c.cm. and begin the <i>deep etching</i>. According to
the depth to be attained repeat the manipulation of strengthening once or
twice. Whenever a corrosion of the lateral coating becomes apparent, coat
freshly, adhering to the above order of operation. For obtaining the necessary
depth ink is applied about <i>ten</i> times, adding wax each time to facilitate
the spreading when warming.</p>

<p>In order to attain a fine, regular lateral coating, great ability in manipulating
the rollers is necessary, since without such the correct degree of strengthening
is never attained. Irregular coating leads, of course, to irregular melting
of the ink; one spot then is already sufficiently wide, while another is not
yet covered. In such cases coating with a brush must be resorted to.</p>

<p>If the necessary depth is attained, the plate is to be freed carefully from the
coating with a brush and oil of turpentine, and then placed in fresh sawdust,
which absorbs the oil of turpentine and leaves behind a clean surface. Now
the work can be criticised in all its parts. To every coating is a corresponding
narrow edge of etching, which is now to be removed in order to make the
plate fit for printing. To removing these edges we must devote our attention.
We begin with the top one, and make preparations thus: Roll out on a clean,
warm stone with faultlessly smooth rollers a very thin gauze-like layer of
etching ink. Likewise warm the zinc plate and roll it in all directions without
pressure till the picture becomes beautifully
black. <span class="xxpn" id="p083">{83}</span></p>

<p>Pressure must not be employed, but the coating must be obtained by
renewed <i>working out</i> of the rollers on the <i>color-slab</i>,
and repeated coating.
When at last the desired strength is obtained, dust with the finest asphaltum
powder, blow the traces of dust out of the hollows, and warm till the layer
becomes slightly brilliant. Next, etch in a new bath of 4000 c.cm. of water
and 40 c.cm. of acid for 7 minutes, wash, and dry well; then, with more ink
on the rollers, coat the dried plate, dust once with resin, heat gently, then
apply the asphaltum and burn in strongly. Thus the first relief is protected
laterally, and the first grade can be etched down completely, without endangering
the drawing. To remove the second grade, we repeat washing, and put
on etching ink mixed with one-third wax. Rolling must continue till the
narrowest spaces of the etching are completely closed. Then follow dusting
with resin, warming, and placing the warm plate in the asphalt, dusting,
removing the excess, and finally burning in.</p>

<p>With this coating a further rounding of the grades can take place (in a bath
of 10°&nbsp;Baumé). Continue this process until all the grades are removed and
the etching appears as perfect as a cast plate.</p>

<p>Since hitherto all publications on chemigraphy have duly described this
method, I believe that I should not enter into further details, improvements,
etc. Suffice it to call attention to weak points. In view of the new method
later to be described, the reader may make a comparison between the two.</p>

<p>A very weak point is the method of strengthening based on the lithographic
process of superimposing new color upon the old color. In consequence of
the repeated melting in of resin, this latter acquires an uneven surface,
which can be blackened in only with great difficulty. Equally untrustworthy
is the lateral protection by <i>melting off</i>, which is only attained with safe
uniformity by skilled workers. And what is more, with the weak coating at
the beginning; even weak acid often works its way through to the etching, so
that the finished etching appears slightly porous, and gives no dense black
print. Also shaking, which is to promote the removal of the metallic mud
and the gas bubbles from the lines of the etching, has an unsatisfactory effect,
inasmuch as the single lines are often thus under-washed.</p>

<p>But the principal defect is that no accurate determination of the degree of
each operation can be made, everything depending on the delicate execution of
the process.</p>

<p>The time that the etching of a correct, deep cliché requires by this method is
from eight to ten hours. This procedure also demands better trained
hands <span class="xxpn" id="p084">{84}</span>
than the Austrian, which, in large establishments, is based on a division of
labor, and in which men trained in a single manipulation, under good supervision,
accomplish the maximum work surely and excellently.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the expenses of the manufacture on a large scale are far
greater, since each etcher draws a greater salary than a workman skilled in a
few manipulations, such as the following method requires.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="The Austrian Method—the Etching On.">THE AUSTRIAN
 METHOD—THE ETCHING ON.</h4>

<p>I have already shown how a transferred plate should be prepared for etching
by this method. Before proceeding to the details, however, we will prepare
the etching baths, which, by the way, may always be employed for several
plates. Corresponding to the three steps of etching, we require three baths of
different concentration to be determined by means of an areometer with a
Baumé scale. The bath for <i>etching on</i> is prepared in strength of 2°&nbsp;Baumé at
a temperature of 18°&nbsp;C. There must be a quantity sufficient to cover the
plate to a depth of 4 to 5 centimetres. The bath for middle etching requires
10°&nbsp;Baumé and a temperature of 18°&nbsp;C.; the bath for deep etching, 18°&nbsp;Baumé.
These baths are prepared at the beginning, and are used for the five successive
stages of etching. If, after continued use, the bath for deep etching should grow
weak, it may be used for middle etching. For protecting the trays, I recommend
a coat of gutta-percha over a well-coated inner surface of asphaltum.
Everything being ready, immerse the prepared plate in the bath, and with an
etching-brush brush the surface of the plate uniformly for two minutes.</p></div>

<p>The hairs of the brush must only rest lightly on the metallic surface. For
determining time, use sand-glasses of two, three, and five minutes. After two
minutes, take the plate out of the acid, wash it well with water, and examine it
carefully. If the effect has not been uniform, see that two minutes more can
be safely given in the etching bath. If by any sort of careless handling the
plate has been injured, dry it with blotting-paper, vaporize the remaining
dampness, and cover the soiled spot with very thick solution of asphaltum in
turpentine. Cool, and continue brushing lightly for two minutes in the bath.</p>

<p>At the end of this time, wash and examine again. Even now everything
will be intact. With very fine drawings, however, lateral action has already
progressed so far that, under all circumstances, the exposed edges must be
covered. Coarser drawings generally stand one or two minutes more.</p>

<p>To try the depth of etching: with your finger-nail on the edge of the
black <span class="xxpn" id="p085">{85}</span>
rim, feel how far the etching-on has proceeded. As soon as the finger-nail
catches, the depth is sufficient, and the sides of the lines may be covered.</p>

<p>For this operation the plate needs, above all, thorough washing, drying on
both sides by blotting-paper and gentle heat, and a temperature of 45°&nbsp;C.
At this temperature place the plate into the finest resin-powder, and rub the
latter several times over the warm drawing, using for this purpose a fine
brush. The protection, which has grown sticky through heating, retains a thin
coating of resin, which, after dusting off the bright metallic spots with a brush
and fine cotton, and after careful fanning off, is reheated to about 50°&nbsp;C. At
this temperature the plate is returned to the white rosin, receives a good
dusting-in, and being freed from excess as before, is heated to about 65°, so
that the easily fusible rosin begins to spread out. At this moment extinguish
the light, and put the plate into the asphaltum, which will attach itself copiously
to the sticky resin. Brush the plate well with the substance, remove
any excess from the bright spots, heat to 80°&nbsp;C.; then place it again into the
asphaltum, brush it, clean it by removing any excess, and heat it to 100°&nbsp;C.,
when a complete combination of the resinous mass takes place, and a uniform
etching varnish is formed. This last coating is extremely regular, and it is
wonderful to see the accuracy with which the lines have been covered. Beginners
are warned to pay attention to the careful cleaning of the bright parts of
the plate when brushing and dusting it; should any resin remain behind, it
melts on, and grows by degrees to a strong yellow tint, which is very difficult
to remove, but very easy to guard against. Never forget to dust off the back.</p>

<p>While the plate is still hot, lean it against the wall, face in, and the back
covered with a solution of shellac.</p>

<p>Now the plate is ready for further etching, which is carried on for two
minutes in the first bath. At the end of two minutes, wash and examine
critically. In almost every case we may etch for a third, or even a fourth time.
It is, however, sufficient for the beginner to know that he has sufficiently etched
in two spaces of two minutes each, after preparing with resin. Trying and
examining with the finger-nail on the black edge will show a fine relief. Should
it be possible to etch for a third space of two minutes, or even of one, without
danger, it is preferable to do so. It should be a rule to proceed as far
as possible, judging from the character of drawing and coating. Experience
is easily gained in two or three trials, since anything can be examined at any
moment. Beginners would do well to use a magnifying-glass with good field
of view in examining, when they can observe the most sensitive portion,
and <span class="xxpn" id="p086">{86}</span>
all changes may easily be noticed. The brush should be used lightly, to prevent
scratching. Usually, it is fastened at right angles to a stick to protect
the hands from the effect of the acid.</p>

<p>To raise the plates out of the tray, lay a gutta-percha thread into the bottom
of each tray, fastened at one end to the top edge of the tray, projecting over
the same on the other side. The plate is placed on the thread while etching.
It may be removed without touching the bath by pulling the free end of the
thread.</p>

<p>As already remarked, the spreading of ink on a surface which is more or less
rough is difficult. For this reason the plate, when etched-on after my method,
is to be washed out with oil of turpentine. A strong brush should be used for
this, and some of the oil rubbed over the plate without pressure. You must
cause a dissolving, not a rubbing off, of the coat. On continuing the addition
of turpentine, the metal grows bright. Take, then, a handful of the coarsest of
pine-wood sawdust and rub off the surface. This removes instantly every
trace of turpentine, leaving a clean surface behind. For the sake of security,
pour on more turpentine, rub with a somewhat softer brush, and remove again
with clean sawdust.</p>

<p>It is important that the wash-table should always remain free from sawdust,
which latter should fall through the grating into a suitable receptacle. If this
rule is disregarded, the wash-brush will soon be a conglomerate of sawdust
and hairs. Sawdust and turpentine will stick to the brush so tightly that a
new brush will have to be purchased.</p>

<p>Now we again examine our work. It is a mark of success if the relief still
shows its original smoothness in all its parts, and has nowhere grown porous.
All the parts must be clear in their correct proportional strength, as seen in the
transfer.</p>

<p>The treatment of the plate from the time of transfer to the close of the
etching-on takes: for the saving of the edges and the white portions of the
drawing, 2 minutes; for preparing twice with asphaltum, 4 minutes; for
varnishing the back and coloring the plate, 4 minutes; for etching-on the
lateral protection, 4 to 5 minutes; for preparing twice with resin, asphaltum,
and varnishing, 16 minutes; for renewed etching, 4 to 5 minutes; and for
washing, 5 minutes—that is, 33 minutes in all. Add 7 minutes for inspection
and retouching, and 40 minutes will be the space allowed for
etching-on. <span class="xxpn" id="p087">{87}</span></p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Middle Etching.">MIDDLE ETCHING.</h4>

<p>In order to give to the middle tints of the drawing the depth necessary for
printing, we begin with a new blacking-in. We need for this purpose excellent,
smooth, and hard rollers, which are immersed in minium and linseed oil, and
are then left to dry for a short time. Contrary to the French method, we
need here a thin composition for the etching ink, obtained by concocting equal
parts of paraffine, suet, beeswax, and ordinary ink, prepared in an excess of
good linseed oil. (Ready-made color of right composition may be had of E.
Liesegang, in Dusseldorf, and other dealers.)</p></div>

<p>This color, when of right composition, possesses the power of absorbing
resin-powder, and changes in combination with the same, when heated, to a
compact, very solid, yet brittle mass.</p>

<p>Of this color, which is soft as butter, take a portion on a knife-point, and
spread it upon the smooth rollers, forming a perfectly uniform layer. The
complete covering is done by rolling, changing the adjustment at intervals.
When a perfectly uniform, oily coat is spread on the color-slab and the rollers,
begin rolling-in the washed plate.</p>

<p>Do not exert any pressure, but roll, carrying the handles so as to black the
relief only from the surface of the rollers. Of course, it cannot be prevented,
and is of no consequence, if ink attaches itself to the large white spots. Rolling
continues till the oily brown coating has deposited itself uniformly. Exercise
care in order not to get more ink on some spots than on others. The plate,
now completely rolled, is placed in the finely powdered resin, with which it
must be completely covered. For the space of two minutes the oily color
absorbs the powder, which should, therefore, be strewn on it and rubbed off
repeatedly. If saturation in the cold has taken place, dust off lightly with
brush and cotton, blow off well, and heat uniformly to 35°&nbsp;C. The resin
should not melt now, but should only grow sticky and combine intimately with
the color, which forms the binding material. This change is observed immediately
in the change resulting in the gray resin coat. As soon as the change
occurs (beware of unequal heating), again place the warm plate into the resin,
saturate as before, dust out, blow strongly on the bright, metallic spaces, to
remove remaining traces of resin, and heat to 50°–55°&nbsp;C. At this temperature
cover the film with fine asphalt powder, dust off as before, and heat to 65°&nbsp;or
70°&nbsp;C. In this condition the plate is again saturated with asphalt, and the
layer, after careful dusting and blowing, is heated until it grows
slightly <span class="xxpn" id="p088">{88}</span>
brilliant. Thus a complete coating is formed, and the plate has the appearance
of Fig. 6. The black spots represent the dirt which has clung to the
intensest lights, and must be removed. But before attempting this, we varnish
the back of our plate with a solution of shellac, and cool it completely in
water.</p>

<div class="figleft imwth08" id="fig06">
<img src="images/i088.jpg" width="252" height="213" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 6.</div>
</div>

<p>Now take a very coarse scraper, ground with a sharp edge; hold it between
the index and middle fingers, and scratch away the dirt from the light spots,
making the edge of the scratcher draw the
strokes close together. The brittle backing
breaks off finely, and in a few minutes
the dirt is removed and the plate is ready
for etching. If (which will only happen to
beginners) the drawing should be scratched,
the exposed spot must be covered, by
means of a brush, with a thick, warm
solution of asphalt in turpentine; the dirt
which was scratched loose is brushed off,
and the plate goes into the bath for middle
etching for about three minutes. Brushing
and washing follow in the same way
as in the previous operation. At the expiration of three minutes inspect
(with or without a magnifying glass); places that have been uncovered must
instantly be covered with asphaltum, as already directed. Etching is continued
till the lateral coating no longer protects the first relief, which generally takes
place after the third period (in about nine minutes) in a new bath, but requires
twelve to fifteen minutes in an old one. It is proved by the existence of only
a narrow thread alongside of the relief. The moment can be well ascertained.
If we wish to be sure of it we may do so by exposing the edge of the black
rim at different places; the width of the thread is then apparent, and a safe
conclusion may be drawn from the single spots as to the whole plate. If not
enough middle etching has taken place, the thread remains wide and requires
an extraordinary clean etching, which may lead to the picture growing thin and
endanger the finest lines. Care, then, is necessary to ascertain the right moment
of suspending the middle etching, and of continuing in the above-described
manner with oil of turpentine, brushing, sawdusting, and washing. After
drying and brushing off the sawdust with a strong brush, we have the clean
plate ready for examination. We observe the grade of etching produced
by <span class="xxpn" id="p089">{89}</span>
middle etching parallel to the contours of the different parts, and can safely
assert that the process has taken its natural course. Etchings without real
deep places (as high lights) might here be <i>etched clean</i>—that is, might undergo
removal of the formed <i>etching grade</i>. Yet it is preferable to place the edge of
the drawing as low as possible, to prevent a tendency to crookedness, so-called
facetting, and to get a deep edge for nailing the plate on wood. The outward
appearance of the etching improves considerably, and the cliché can be fastened
much more securely. The chemigraphist must endeavor to satisfy the demands
of the printer in all respects, and should omit nothing that serves to perfect his
work. Thus only can he gain a good reputation both for himself and for his
work.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Deep Etching.">DEEP ETCHING.</h4>

<p>Having been successfully treated in the middle etching process, the plate
needs only depression of the larger light spots. Some simplify this part of the
work by cutting out the highest lights by means of a chisel, reverse ground.
This can easily be done after a little practice, and often saves time and acid.
Care should be taken with the chisel; the plate should lie on a flat surface and
the cutting twist be executed lightly and regularly. If this course is decided
upon and is applied to the highest lights, proceed to the execution of the deep
etching. Such chiselling does not happen in my laboratory, since I prefer to
etch all plates alike to their normal depth.</p></div>

<p>An excess of ink is now well spread over the rollers and the plate is rolled
in all directions. Close up all the middle tints and give the acid room only in
the densest lights. This coating is done by warming the regularly covered
plate to 31°&nbsp;C., and allowing the ink to flow down rapidly and cover the
recesses. A second coating with slow manipulating of the rollers and manipulation
of the handles without pressure, will yield a sufficient coat from above.
If, despite this, certain parts should not be sufficiently blackened, rub on more
ink till the covering is sufficient and the side protection perfect.</p>

<p>As in middle etching, we must proceed to the formation of an etching varnish
by dusting with gums, placing into resin, by lightly rubbing this resin on in
constantly renewed layers, till the absorptive power of the ink ceases; then
warming and dusting warm with the same resin to complete saturation; then
raising the heat as above, and dusting with asphaltum to saturation, heating
stronger and finally placing the hot plate into asphaltum, which again secures
all parts covered with ink and
resin. <span class="xxpn" id="p090">{90}</span></p>

<p>At the different times of removing the dust, pay particular attention to the
bright metallic parts. Over-removal of dust removes resin from the layer;
under-removal leaves behind an obstinate yellow tint in the bright spots.
Practice and experience readily prove the best teachers in this respect.</p>

<p>The final heating of the etching varnish must be pushed so far that an intimate
connection is effected between all of its parts. This is easily noticeable
from the uniform gloss of the mass. While
still hot, the back of the plate is carefully
varnished and cooling is promoted by dipping
it into cold water.</p>

<div class="figleft imwth08" id="fig07">
<img src="images/i090.jpg" width="252" height="219" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 7.</div>
</div>

<p>But few spots are to be removed by
chiselling (see Fig. 7), for the rollers have
only blacked the middle of the highest
lights. These spots, as indicated in middle
etching, are scratched bright with a chisel.
It is important always to scrape off the
white edge around the drawing. Scratching
of the plate does not even happen with
beginners, except in cases of gross carelessness.
If it does happen, a good covering with the turpentine solution of
asphalt must be used. When this is all done properly we proceed to etch.</p>

<p>The process of etching by the aid of a brush is continued in periods of five
minutes each. It is necessary to examine the side covering carefully at the
end of every operation; a diligent brushing off of the surface is also to be
recommended. Etching is continued until, by degrees, the lateral coating
decreases and the grade grows narrower. At this juncture—that is, after
about five to six operations (twenty-five minutes) the necessary depth is attained.
In few cases (and almost always with beginners), it happens that a single coating
does not suffice for deep etching without endangering the plate. In such cases
wash the plate, coat it a second time, and form a second etching varnish.</p>

<p>When the depth is satisfactory the plate is washed and the new grade may
be criticised.</p>

<p>After a proper examination, we proceed to the</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Round Etching.">ROUND ETCHING.</h4>

<p>Its object is to remove the last formed grade. Coat the plate with a very
uniform coating of ink, corresponding to the one used in middle etching.
A <span class="xxpn" id="p091">{91}</span>
criterion for correct coating is, that only the grade caused by middle etching be
covered, while the grade from deep etching must remain exposed. Remember
also that in heating the plate a further spreading is caused by melting.</p></div>

<p>To the inexperienced it may happen that the grade caused by deep etching is
of variable width. These places must be removed by working over with a
graver before continuing, as otherwise we will not attain symmetrical round
etching.</p>

<p>The plate prepared for the latter treatment is only dusted once in resin, and
then blown out. It is then heated to 45°&nbsp;C., and is dusted and heated twice
with asphaltum at increasing temperature, just as in both the previous processes.
Nothing now remains to be scratched away. After having varnished
the back, the plate is etched in the middle etching bath two or three times for
three minutes. At the end of each period examine whether another whole
period is necessary, or whether rounding the plate requires less time. When
this is over (several parts, which perhaps were already finished beforehand,
have been covered), wash and approach the next problem, the removal of the
grade resulting from the middle etching. This is called</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Clean Etching.">CLEAN ETCHING.</h4>

<p>Upon the clean, smooth rollers spread thick transfer ink and roll it out
perfectly. It is advisable to warm the stone previously with a little alcohol,
which promotes the working out of the color. When the surface of the color
has become perfectly uniform the plate is rolled in slowly and without pressure.
Pressure would deposit too much color in the finest recesses, and prevent the
clean etching and sharpening of the same, thus causing lack of harmony in the
prints.</p></div>

<p>It is better to coat the shadows with a pad, as they require more color.</p>

<p>The plate, thus blackened, is to be dusted once with the finest asphalt powder,
then freed from excess by dusting off and blowing until the coating becomes
brilliant.</p>

<p>Clean etching then takes place in the bath for etching on, in periods of one
minute each, and repeatedly until the last thread has disappeared.</p>

<p>Now everything is ready for a proof, and for subsequent mounting.</p>

and deep etching, and admits of an instructive comparison during the progress
of the work. <span class="xxpn" id="p092">{92}</span></p>

<p>Proofs are made from the cleaned plate (the back of which has been scratched
clean) in the following manner: Upon a good lithographic roller place a
quantity of the best ink and coat the
etching uniformly. Help the shadows
along by dabbing on some ink with a
leather pad. When this is done, carefully
rub off the excess in the lightest spots, and
fix the plate in the rolling-press; place on
it a sheet of well-calendered tissue paper,
next a sheet of writing paper, a sheet of
Bristol paper, and a cardboard. With
very little pressure (the thickness of one
cardboard less than in the transfer) draw
it through. If the print is too weak, place
paper below, sheet by sheet. The stronger spots may be blackened separately.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Finishing And Mounting The Plate.">FINISHING AND MOUNTING THE PLATE.</h4>

<p>The first thing to be done is the removal of the black edge left by etching
and the sawing out of such spots in the drawing as were spared for this from
the beginning. The waste may be removed by means of a circular saw or a
fine-toothed carpenter’s saw. Do not, however, forget to leave behind a margin
of about three millimetres for the purpose of nailing the plate to the wood.
The edges must be smoothed with a graver, filed and chipped off to a suitable
plane, since sawing produces a sharp edge.</p></div>

<p>To remove the spots spared in the drawing, bore a hole through the metal at
that spot with an American gimlet, introduce a scroll saw, and thus cut out the
metal. The edge should be worked over with a dog-leg chisel.</p>

<p>By aid of the borer we also make the conical holes in the edge, through
which the nails are to be hammered. Elevations caused on the back of the
plate by boring should be removed by filing.</p>

<p>The block of wood which is to raise the height of the plate to that of
type should be cut from perfectly dry maple, oak, or mahogany wood. With
the plate it must just reach to the top of the type; the sides must be parallel,
and all should be perfectly smooth.</p>

<p>Cutting at right angles can be done with a circular saw or with the aid of a
mitre saw used by printers for such work. For exact examination of
height, <span class="xxpn" id="p093">{93}</span>
pass the block and zinc through the caliber-bridge (Fig. 9). Roughen the
base and top surface of the block with a toothing-plane. When convinced that
the block fits perfectly, nail the etching upon it, taking care to drive the heads
of the nails well into the holes provided
for them, otherwise they will show in
the print. If other small details are
noticed, they may be removed with a
dog-leg chisel.</p>

<span class="blksmaller">HINTS FROM ALL SOURCES.</span></h3></div>

<p>Although the number increases almost every week, there are but few
persons who understand photo-reproductive processes in all their details. Those
who do, have been so chary of giving of what they know, that our literature
on the subject is very scanty indeed. Consequently, as all the hints that are
obtainable are very welcome, I have collated a few from various sources, and
make a mosaics of them here for the general good.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<p>Every would-be photo-engraver, if he is not already a skilled photographer,
should obtain and study a good photographic text-book. If he proposes to make
his own drawings, he should also obtain Burnet’s <i>Essays on Art</i>. The first will
not only teach the best formula for the production of negatives, but it will also
enjoin the importance of being careful, cleanly, and exact in all the manipulations.
The second will teach how to draw according to the best rules of art.
Remember always, the old injunction, <i>whatever you are, be best</i>! After the
regular photographic manipulations are well looked after, the preparation of
the drawing should have attention.—<span class="smcap">E<span>DWARD</span></span> L.
<span class="smcap">W<span>ILSON.</span></span></p></div>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="As To The Drawing.">AS TO THE DRAWING.</h4>

<p>There are two separate and distinct styles of drawing for reproductive
purposes, whether the artistic engraver be employed, or any of the means of
automatic engraving be used. These two methods are technically known
respectively as <i>fac simile</i> drawing, and drawing in wash. The former consists
in the sole employment of lines, in which the shading is to be produced as well
as the outline of a picture. Every line and mark that is subsequently to appear
in the engraving must be traced in the original. This description of drawing
is applicable to wood engraving, to line engraving upon copper or steel, as well
as to all the methods for automatically producing blocks for relief printing.
The line method is also universally adopted by
etchers in <i>intaglio</i>.</p></div>

<p>Successfully to prepare drawings for photographic reproduction it is essential
that some knowledge should be possessed of the fundamental principles
of <span class="xxpn" id="p095">{95}</span>
photography, as well as an acquaintance with the capabilities of the particular
process of production which is to be employed. Thus, the material upon which
the drawing is to be made should be of such a character as will yield a strong
and well-defined contrast to the lines of the drawing; while the pigment
employed for the drawing should be as black as can be procured. White
Bristol board of fine surface, and the best India ink meet these conditions.
A blue-black does not form a desirable drawing medium, but the introduction
of red or orange into the composition should serve to intensify the photographic
image. To draw upon a dark orange-colored paper with a pale blue-gray ink
would be simply to disregard all photographic principles, for the photographic
value of the paper and of the ink would be nearly equal, and the drawing
would consequently be lost.</p>

<p>Uniformity of color in the drawing is also desirable, and the artist should
resist the natural tendency to express distance and to produce his effects by
diminishing the intensity of color in parts of his picture. From a drawing
uniform in color a satisfactory negative is obtained; but, in the other case, the
photographer must estimate an average duration of exposure, and will rarely
escape the dilemma of some portions being overexposed while others are comparatively
undeveloped. This theory receives illustration from the fact that
very good subdued effects can be obtained from well-executed pencil drawings,
where this uniformity of color is preserved. A longer exposure may be
required, but every part of the picture will be equally developed.</p>

<p>To return to the matter of the paper used, color is not the only important
consideration. If the surface of the paper is irregular and coarse in texture,
such as painters in water-color delight in, good results must not be expected.
A negative, taken in the ordinary way from a drawing made on such material,
would inevitably reproduce all the inequalities of the texture of the paper, to
the manifest injury of the more delicate parts of the drawing. In reproductions
from old prints or printed books, the conditions and character of the
paper present some of the greatest difficulties with which the photographer has
to contend. The ridges in the surface of the paper cast shadows which are too
faithfully reproduced in the negative. The employment of a diffusive rather
than a direct light is the usual remedy, but the best way of dealing with the
difficulty is that employed in the studio of the Autotype Company. The
original is laid upon the floor under a strong light, and the camera set at an
angle of forty-five degrees.</p>

<p>Mr. Alfred Dawson informs me that he inclines to the opinion, founded
upon <span class="xxpn" id="p096">{96}</span>
his extensive experience and untiring experiment, that it is desirable to get rid
of the surface of the paper altogether, by covering it with a substance similar
to an enamel.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<p>In conclusion, the conditions required in the successful preparation of drawings
for photographic reproduction, may be thus briefly summarized: That a
sufficient photographic contrast should exist between the pigment employed
and the material upon which the drawing is made; that a paper should be
selected which is smooth and without water-mark, and white; that the drawing
material may be pencil or ink, in which blue is not a component.—<span class="smcap">J<span>AMES</span></span> S.

<h4 title="Fading Out The Photograph.">FADING OUT THE PHOTOGRAPH.</h4>

<p>For newspaper line work excellent results may be obtained by drawing
over a photograph, and then fading out the photographic parts not wanted.
There are several methods, but the following is the most simple and the easiest
to manage: Make a weak solution of cyanide of potassium and add a flake or
two of iodine. When the drawing is made with water-proof ink and on a
photograph printed upon bromo-gelatine paper the above solution flowed over
it will at once cause such portions of the image as have not been drawn upon
with the ink, to fade away and leave nothing but a fine ink sketch against a
perfectly white background.—<span class="smcap">R<span>OBERTS</span></span> &amp;

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="The Reversal Of Drawings (Negative Printing).">THE
 REVERSAL OF DRAWINGS (NEGATIVE PRINTING).</h4>

<p>This very simple and very safe method is to be recommended especially for
advertisements in papers and for titles of books, and can be made both by aid
of photography (by a transparency) and without it,
in the following manner:</p></div>

<p>Make a copy, on copy-paper, of the drawing to be reversed, using an ink of
gum, glycerine, and aniline, and transfer it carefully, without using too much
water, when loosening. Dry the plate, and pour over it a solution of 1 part
of asphaltum, 1 part Venetian turpentine, in 18 parts benzole; then allow to
dry upon a plate. Place the plate into a weak soda solution, and develop with
a fine pad of cotton, till the drawing stands clear. Ordinarily I employ the
following method: A plate prepared for transfer is uniformly cleansed with
gallic acid and then coated with gum, as in the case of blackening a transferred
drawing, while both solutions are left to dry spontaneously. This done, the
coating of gum and gallic acid is thoroughly washed off, and the plate is carefully
dried and gently warmed. The transferred drawing must be made
on <span class="xxpn" id="p097">{97}</span>
paper with an easily soluble layer composed as follows: dissolve 100 grammes
of wheat starch—<i>i. e.</i>, starch <i>made</i> of wheat—in 400 c.cm. of rain-water; raise
1 litre of water to boiling and dissolve therein: 50 grammes of common salt,
75 grammes of glycerine, 50 grammes of gelatine, and 25 grammes of molasses;
when these are well dissolved and taken up, add slowly the wheat-starch, stirring
continually; then allow to boil a short time so that we may dissolve it
without an excess of water after the ordinary transfer of the picture. When
this has been done, we wash it again with a soft brush and water, dry, dust
twice, and burn in thoroughly with asphaltum. Place the plate in a very
weak bath of nitric acid (10 cubic centimetres of acid to 1 litre of water), and
rock it lightly for about two minutes until the zinc changes color. Then wash,
dry, and warm.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<p>The combination of gum and gallic acid is broken up by this etching in all
those places which were not protected through the transferred drawing, and the
latter itself, in the subsequent blackening with chemical India-ink, forms the
coating and protection against a combination of the zinc below. It is best to
blacken it with a brush and to warm the plate until the ink has become dry.
Now moisten again with gallic acid and gum, wash the plate (without great
pressure) with spirits of turpentine, rub on more of the solution of gum, and
blacken as usual. Practice will insure safe working by this method.—J. O.

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Etching Apparatus.">ETCHING APPARATUS.</h4>

<p>It does not come within the province of this work to instruct in the preparation
of inks and colors for etching or for printing, since such articles are better
purchased of the dealers ready prepared. In all cases the choicest results are
obtained by using the best apparatus and the purest materials. There is no
economy in “getting on” with the “cheap.”</p></div>

<p>A few hints as to some of the “tools” which are found convenient in practice:
For sifting the fine <i>resin dust</i>, a machine is employed, known to
sieve manufacturers as “the <i>composition</i> sieve.” It consists of the ordinary
sieve, having on each side a cover with a bottom of calf skin. The sieve-bottom
is made of the finest silk texture. (See Fig. 10.)</p>

<p>For fixing and melting-in of the drawing on metal, I use a grate made of a
wooden frame with diagonal iron rods. This form is preferable to the ordinary
grate, because it allows the flame free access to the metal plate. Inasmuch as
the heat is strongest in the <i>centre</i>, the cross-bars protect the centre of the plate
from burning and from warping. The source of heat is either an
alcohol <span class="xxpn" id="p098">{98}</span>
lamp (Fig. 11) in which cotton soaked in alcohol is ignited (the cover shown in
the drawing serves to smother the flame), or a strong gas flame (Bunsen burner).
The adoption of the latter mode is advisable.</p>

<div class="imctr01" id="fig10"><div id="fig11">
<img src="images/i098a.jpg" width="600" height="113" alt="" />
<div class="caption">

<tr>
 <td class="tdwth-b">Fig. 10. The Sieve.</td>
 <td class="tdwth-c">Fig. 11.</td></tr></table>
</div></div></div>

<p>Formerly I employed a plain cast-iron heating-plate, with
a gas or a petroleum flame. The zinc plate, however, being
in direct contact with the hot surface, warped very much. I
obviated that somewhat by covering the heating-plate with
a piece of wire-gauze. The strata of hot air thus obtained
between the cast-iron and the zinc plate heats the latter
equally throughout, and prevents warping. Still I prefer the
direct method.</p>

<p>For freeing the plate from resin-dust, employ a strong
pair of ordinary bellows.</p>

<p>The table (Fig. 12) for washing the coating material from
the plate consists of a heavy framework, upon which rests a
wooden grate. A massive table-board is not to be recommended,
as the dirty sawdust adheres to the same, while with the
other it easily falls through the openings into a box, and
leaves the table free and clear.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 12.</div>
</div>

<p>The measuring or cal­i­bre-bridge (see Fig. 7) serves
to de­ter­mine ac­cu­rate­ly wheth­er the ready plates have
the height of type. A rule of for­ty <span class="xxpn"
id="p099">{99}</span> cen­ti­met­res will suf­fice for any
plate. No plate should leave the work­shop with­out hav­ing been
test­ed as to its thick­ness or height on this ins­tru­ment.</p>

<p>The zinc plane is of or­di­nary con­struc­tion, to the bot­tom
of which is at­tached a doub­le lay­er of hard wood. The iron
being ar­ranged for scrap­ing can be in­sert­ed in a po­si­tion
just the re­verse of the or­di­nary plane.</p>

<p>The “hand-bridge” is a strong ru­ler, thir­ty cen­ti­met­res
long, and five cent­i­met­res wide, to the ends of which are
fas­tened two blocks of wood one cen­ti­met­re high. It serves as
a sup­port for the hand in re­touch­ing.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<p>The rollers of the “chemigraphist,” and also the pads, are of greatest importance.
For etching by the French process we need a good, rough roller, and a
faultless, smooth one; for the Vienna process only the latter is needed, in
addition to a smooth, tight leather ball or pad, such as was used in the art of
printing prior to the introduction of rollers. A perfectly smooth surface is
obtained by covering the rollers with a dryer, and allowing them to dry in the
open air. A solution of shellac with camphor, applied like furniture polish,
also yields a fine surface.—J. O.
<span class="smcap">M<span>ORCH.</span></span></p></div>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="The Best Drying Box.">THE BEST DRYING BOX.</h4>

<p>After bichromatizing the gelatine sheet for printing the transfer image, I
proceed with the drying in a box constructed as follows:</p></div>

<p>The box has four walls or sides of cloth, or any other stuff that allows the
air to pass through, and must have a solid bottom, which will allow the attachment
of a heating apparatus beneath it. In this box is a cylinder which turns
on its own axle, and which can be set in rotation from the outside when the box
is closed. Upon this cylinder the gelatine paper, as we may call it, is placed,
and the box closed. A very equalizing drying is thus obtained, by keeping
the heating apparatus under the bottom of the box constantly at a steady,
uniform heat. By these means, it will be noticed:</p>

<p>1. That an uneven running down of the chrome-layer is avoided, and uneven
drying also positively prevented in consequence of the centrifugal force.</p>

<p>2. That the drying by the draft of air is regulated, and at the same time the
air can be driven to a more rapid current.</p>

<p>3. That the grain formed by this extraordinary method is unusually perfect,
and the nature of the grain more pleasing to the eye than when formed by
chlorides.</p>

<p>4. That, as already stated, a rolling up or an uneven drying is hereby <span class="xxpn" id="p100">{100}</span>
positively prevented, as the paper is placed tight around the cylinder. And now for
the main advantage:</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<p>This so dried paper is ready for use, and, when exposed to light, under a
negative, produces a perfect and correct picture, which, when rolled up with
transfer ink and developed in water, is ready for transferring direct on to the
lithographic stone, or on to a metal plate, and to be further proceeded with as
usual.—<span class="smcap">E<span>DWARD</span></span>
<span class="smcap">M<span>EISSNER.</span></span></p></div>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="To Produce Grain On A Negative.">TO PRODUCE GRAIN ON A NEGATIVE.</h4>

<p>The negative is taken, and a solid pigment of Chinese ink sprinkled on it
with the Air Brush, by which it gets a wonderfully fine grain. A coarser
grain is made in a similar way, by sprinkling with a knife over a tooth-brush
that has been dipped in Chinese ink. The Air Brush, however, will always
be found the most suitable instrument, and now a wide field for its use is
opened to artists of all classes. Instead of using Chinese ink, gamboge, or any
other solid and well-covering pigment may be used.</p></div>

<div class="keeptogether">
<p>For the practical photo-engraver, lithographer, photo-lithographer, and other
men of experience in photo-mechanical processes, no further explanation is
required. They will at once see the <i>superiority</i> of this process over everything
that has hitherto appeared. After the information we have just given, they
will all be enabled to do work by this process. It will henceforward be easy to
produce photo-lithographs for lithographic printing as well as printing plates
for the type press <i>without difficulty, in a short time, and at trifling

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="On The Use Of Acids.">ON THE USE OF ACIDS.</h4>

<p>A few hints on use of the acids will form my contribution to your work:</p></div>

<p>In order to obtain a proper resistance and firmness in the lines, it is necessary
to prevent the acid from making the base that supports them too thin, and to
strengthen the base by giving the depression the form of a V, and the base
itself the form of an A. The depth must be great enough in the broad blanks
to prevent the roller from sinking (although there is no danger of this when
the lines are close together), and thus soiling them. A useless depth between
very thin sides might weaken them; but, in the process employed, the attack
by the acid continues only in proportion to the width of the spaces to be
excavated. <span class="xxpn" id="p101">{101}</span></p>

<p>These results are obtained as follows: The prepared plate bearing the design
is inked with a thick ink containing a little wax, and is placed in a trough with
acidulated water, which slightly attacks the metal.</p>

<p>The trough is mounted so as to rock, and is kept in motion by a lever
actuated by a steam motor. The water moves to and fro over the entire
surface, and keeps continually washing the parts that are not protected against
its action. No local saturation, therefore occurs, and the continuously renewed
liquid attacks the bottom as well as the sides of the hollow. The sides would
soon be rendered too thin were the biting-in too long continued, and for this
reason the first attack is made with great care. It is upon this that depends
the sharpness of the proof. The acid used is nitric, so dilute that it is scarcely
perceptible to the taste, and in the proportion of about one and a half ounces
to a quart of water. The acidity is kept up by a small quantity of acid of 36°,
that falls drop by drop from a bottle provided with a cock. After about a
quarter of an hour, the plate is taken out, and the operation repeated as generally
directed.</p>

<p>Remember this: At every new biting-in the acidity of the bath is increased,
and, when the broad parts alone remain exposed to the attack, acid of 6°&nbsp;B.
may be used. In this state, the zinc plate, taken from the bath and washed
and dried, is treated with benzine, and then with potash, in order to remove all
fatty matter. It may then be seen that the sides of the hollows do not exhibit
a regular sloping surface, but a series of ridges corresponding to the series of
bitings-in. As these might take the ink, and affect the purity of the lights and
shades, it is necessary to remove them by an operation analogous to the first,
but carried on quickly in an opposite direction. With this intent, the plate,
well cleaned and heated upon the iron table, is inked while hot, with a composition
formed of two parts printing ink and one part each of resin and beeswax.
This ink, which can be used hot only, descends along the sides of the
depressions, and when it has got half way to the bottom the plate is cooled,
and the inking is renewed so as to well cover the entire surface.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<p>It must not be believed that in practice these operations can be conducted
without extreme care. A want of attention, unsuitable ink, or a too high or
low temperature, may lead to the loss or poor execution of the piece. It is
often objected that the lines in this style of plates have not the boldness of
those produced by the graver. It is not for us to answer the question whether
this is a merit or a defect; artists generally endeavor to employ paper with
an irregular and granular surface, and which is far from giving such
boldness; <span class="xxpn" id="p102">{102}</span>
and he perhaps would be poorly appreciated who should present upon glazed
paper a drawing made with the pen and resembling a picture made with the

<h4 title="Multiplication of Zinc Etchings by Galvanic Means
And by Stereotyping.">MULTIPLICATION OF ZINC ETCHINGS BY GALVANIC MEANS
AND BY STEREOTYPING.</h4>

<p>Multiplication of printing-blocks by galvanoplastic, or stereotyping, is not
so easy as in case of woodcuts or type. The main difficulty lies in some
peculiarities of the process of etching, especially if the plate has been produced
by the French method. The reproduction of a form is often impossible,
since the matrix is caught on certain rough spots and then tears, thus rendering
galvanoplastic reproductions imperfect.</p></div>

<p>Having very frequent opportunity of making matrices from plates, I call
the etcher’s attention to several points upon which the success of the work
depends. On no condition whatever may any parts of the plate be corroded
from beneath, as wax or gutta-percha will invariably tear when lifting off the
impression (mould).</p>

<p>In the second place, the bottom of the etching must be perfectly smooth, not
rough; the single grades, left by etching, must be removed, and the lines must
incline perfectly smooth toward the depth of the etching.</p>

<p>In stereotyping, the process of drying presents special difficulties, since with
heat the wood warps and distorts the plate; the cold process, on the other
hand, does not give equally sharp impressions. For this purpose I have
mounted the plates on lead instead of on wood, and am thus enabled to get
sharp impressions and to apply hot drying.</p>

<p>Instead of paste, I employ light magnesia; instead of oiling the plate before
planing or rolling it in, I give it a high polish with stearine oil and rouge by
means of a circular brush, and brush it once more with talc. Thus I am sure
of success.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Preparing Zinc Plates On The Printer’s Press.">PREPARING
 ZINC PLATES ON THE PRINTER’S PRESS.</h4>

<p>A wood-cut gives the <i>outrunners</i> of the finest portions in a plane which runs
downward; an etching, on the contrary, shows the whole engraving in one
plane. According to this the <i>outrunners</i> (the borders) often print somewhat
hard, unless care is taken to alleviate this fault. This will be easy to the
experienced workman. <span class="xxpn" id="p103">{103}</span></p></div>

<p>Starting from the fact that a zinc plate is easily bent, place something under
the back of the <i>heavy</i> portions in mounting, and when nailing drive the nails
tight in the white lights and on the edges; thus the borders are deepened, and
<i>print</i> softer.</p>

<p>In this manner an experienced and practised hand can produce effects
impossible in any other way.</p>

<p>For printing on rotary machines, galvanos are used in many places. But
a zinc plate may be excellently fastened in the following manner:</p>

<p>Clean the back well and solder the back with soft solder, as is customary in
galvanic backing. Then attach it lightly to its place on the wooden or metal
block, hammer or roll in the plate without paying special attention to the zinc
plate, dry the matrix, and lift it from the form. After preparing for casting
take the zinc plate from the wooden block, bend it while hot, put it back into
its position in the matrix, cover the edges with tissue paper and paste, dry the
edges with an iron, place into the casting apparatus and cast as usual. In this
manner the zinc plate (metal, cast from a matrix) is in place at exactly the
height of the type and will print excellently. (The face is to be slightly oiled
before fastening in the matrix, to prevent any sticking of the lead.)</p>

<p>As a <i>cover</i> for the printing cylinder, I have always found paper most serviceable,
although covers of English leather are also advantageous, especially for
large editions. I should not recommend felt.</p>

<p>The rollers for printing zinc plates should be held with somewhat stronger
tension than for printing of wood-engravings.</p>

<p>As a method of preparing, I recommend the gradating of the lights and
shades, known to every intelligent machinist. Wherever possible, highly
calendered paper should be used, as it gives the best results.</p>

<h4 title="Etching With Sulphate Of Copper Solution.">ETCHING
 WITH SULPHATE OF COPPER SOLUTION.</h4>

<p>Nitric acid may be replaced by sulphate of copper, especially in the first
periods of etching, and etching can be obtained both in a galvanic way and by
easy shaking of the tray. The sulphuric acid of the copper sulphate combines
with the zinc and the copper, and when liberated, precipitates as an amorphous,
muddy substance.</p></div>

<p>Although this process has almost entirely fallen into disuse, the most important
points are treated of below.</p>

<p><i>The bath.</i>—Dissolve pure copper sulphate (of the strength of 9°&nbsp;Beaumé) at
a temperature of 15°&nbsp;C. Etch galvanically in this bath by placing in it a
clean <span class="xxpn" id="p104">{104}</span>
copper dish. The plate prepared for etching as per
page <a href="#p084" title="go to p. 84">84,</a> is rubbed bright at
the four corners and four S-shaped narrow strips of sheet copper are so
fastened to the bright zinc that the S-shaped end rises about three millimetres
over the picture. Then place the plate face downward for three minutes into
the bath, above the copper plate, which is electrically connected with the zinc
by brass strips, so that instantly a strong galvanic current is set up. The
etchings are found to be very satisfactory and interesting. In three periods
(nine minutes) a beautiful preliminary etching is obtained with rather perpendicular
faces.</p>

<p>I cannot recommend etching by shaking, as the sediment causes rupture
of the finest lines.</p>

<h4 title="Process For High Etching In Relief.">PROCESS
 FOR HIGH ETCHING IN RELIEF.</h4>

<p>Experienced etchers can also apply their art to the reproduction of drawings
by means of the printer’s press, in the following manner:</p></div>

<p>A plate, ready for etching and free from grease, is cleaned with weakly
acidified water, the remaining water drawn off with a blotter, and the plate
gently heated. By means of a pad a fine paste of graphite is rubbed upon the
surface; it is then moderately heated and a very thin gauze-like layer of warm
white wax is applied to the graphite surface. After cooling the plate, spread
upon it a coat consisting of the finest orange-colored chrome yellow (rubbed to
a fine dough with water and gum). In this ground layer we can erase as for
deep etching.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<p>Brush the finished surface with writing ink dissolved in benzine (using a fine
wide brush). The plate should be warm. Take a pad made of cotton, dip it
into water and work over the surface in small circles until the image has become
well developed. From this point we can continue according to the usual
method.</p>

<h4 title="The Running Of A Workshop.">THE

<p>The great competition demands of every chemigraphical business a ready,
productive organization, which is also attentive to the rules of economy. In
following out the latter it is advisable to aim at a division of labor. By
giving to the single workmen more practice in each particular manipulation,
the quality of the work is also promoted. To secure a lucrative trade, we need
the following helpers: 1. A foreman thoroughly acquainted with the whole
process. 2. A photographic assistant, who is skilled especially in straight
line <span class="xxpn" id="p105">{105}</span>
reproduction, and who aids in the copying of negatives. 3. A carpenter, at the
same time polisher of the zinc and finisher of the plates, who will also assist at
other things in general. 4. A first manipulator, who understands blacking of
the plates and the examination of the same throughout the whole process. 5.
A man to form the etching varnish on the plates. 6. A man to scrape off. 7.
A man to etch. 8. One to wash plates and to make himself generally useful.
With the aid of such a staff it is possible to produce 2000 square centimetres
of etching daily, and by the addition of a ninth assistant the capacity can be
raised to 3000 square centimetres.</p></div>

<p>A first manipulator can be trained in three months, a carpenter in the same
time, and the others in four to six weeks.</p>

<p>After I have sensitized the gelatine transfer paper I increase the surface
quality by laying it upon a glass plate which has been heated <i>very slightly

with vaseline. I use a squeegee to secure close contact and then stand it up to
dry, say over night. A slight start at one corner with a knife point will cause
the paper to leave the glass readily.</p>

<p>It pays always to get the best material. Nothing is worse than a bad quality
of zinc. I use No. 10. A strong, well-made clotheswringer will answer for

<h4 title="Carbon Printing.">CARBON PRINTING.</h4>

<p>In Chapters III. and IV. on engraving on copper, the resist and relief are
made by what is called in photographic nomenclature the carbon process—that
is, printing in gelatine to which has been added a suitable pigment. This pigmented
gelatine, spread upon paper and dried, is known in commerce as carbon
tissue, and is sold of various colors and degrees of density as regards the quantity
of pigment incorporated with the gelatine. For our purpose that tissue
containing the minimum quantity of pigment is the best (this only applies to
the resist or relief on the copper, not to the transparency necessary for printing
the resist from; in this case what is known as transparency tissue must be
used, and that is made with the maximum quantity of pigment (India ink) incorporated
with the gelatine), but as the subject of making transparencies in
carbon has already been treated of, the present notes will be confined entirely to
developing carbon prints upon copper for resists (Chapter III. for reliefs
Chapter IV.).</p></div>

<p>The carbon tissue of commerce is not sold in a sensitive condition; therefore,
the first care will be to render it sensitive to the action of light, which is done
by immersion in a solution of bichromates of potash and ammonia.</p>

<p>First of all dissolve in eighty ounces of water one and a half ounces of bichromate
of ammonia, and one ounce of bichromate of potassium, and filter.
Then cut the carbon tissue into suitable sized pieces—<i>i. e.</i>, pieces a little
larger than the subject on the transparency or negative to be used, and a little
smaller than the copper plate upon which it is intended to develop the carbon
print; next select a sufficient number of glass plates quite free from scratches
a little larger than the pieces of tissue, now clean these glass plates carefully
by polishing with clean linen or silk cloth free from lint, then dust over
with French chalk and again well polish; then coat with thin plain collodion,
and when the film is well set place the collodionized plate in clean cold water
until the greasy appearance that shows on the first immersion in the water has
disappeared.</p>

<p>Place the filtered bichromate solution in a clean dish, then immerse the
pieces of tissue, one at a time, taking care that no air bells are
allowed to <span class="xxpn" id="p107">{107}</span>
remain upon the surface; if any form, remove them by bursting them with the
fingers. After the tissue has been in the solution for three minutes, take one
of the collodionized and washed plates from the water and remove one of the
pieces of tissue from the bichromate bath, place the two face to face, lowering
the tissue gently down upon the collodion film, then place the glass plate upon
a bench, lay a piece of Macintosh cloth (larger than the plate) over the tissue,
and with a squeegee gently scrape along the Macintosh; this will bring the
carbon tissue into contact with the collodion film, and also expel superfluous
bichromate solution, but care must be taken not to remove too much of the
bichromate else the tissue will be insensitive and print hard. The plate is now
placed upon a rack, and all the remaining pieces being done in the same way
are also placed upon the rack.</p>

<p>The tissue being thus squeegeed into optical contact (the squeegee is made
with a strip of soft rubber fixed between two pieces of wood) with the collodionized
glass, it must be dried in the dark room in a current of warm air, not
higher than 60°&nbsp;F., else the pigmented gelatine will melt and be useless (bye
the bye, the bichromate solution in hot weather should be iced so as to keep
the temperature below 50°&nbsp;F.).</p>

<p>When the tissue is dry it is stripped from the glass and stored in a tin tube,
and care must be taken to keep it away from the light, as if the tissue be once
exposed to the light even for a short time, the action will go on in the dark.</p>

<p>In treating of the transparencies, it is mentioned that the subject on the transparency
or negative is marked, this being necessary to form what is called a
safe edge to the carbon print. If such a safe edge be not provided, the carbon
print will not adhere to the copper during development; therefore, the extreme
edges of the tissue must be guarded from the light during the exposure in the
printing frame.</p>

<p>The exposure to light under the negative or transparency must be timed by
means of an actinometer, which may be improvised by dividing a strip of
tracing paper into ten spaces, and numbering these spaces so:</p>

<div class="imctr01">
<img src="images/i107.jpg" width="600" height="91" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Write the figures with good black ink and then cut other pieces of white
tracing paper into strips of the same
width. <span class="xxpn" id="p108">{108}</span></p>

<p>Now lay the piece of tracing paper with the numbers on it, upon a piece of
glass 4&#x202f;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#8260;&#xfeff;<sub>4</sub>&#160;×
3&#x202f;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#8260;&#xfeff;<sub>4</sub>
inches, and fix it in the centre,
then place thicknesses of tracing
paper over this so that space 2 has three thicknesses of tracing paper, space 3
five thicknesses, space 4 seven thicknesses, space 5 eight, space 6 nine, and so
on up to 10. Now if a piece of ordinary sensitive albumen paper is put into a
frame behind this screen, it will form an actinometer, and when, after exposure
to light the figure 5 is just visible, five tints are registered.</p>

<p>This actinometer will with practice enable the operator to judge when the
carbon tissue has been exposed sufficiently long; the only guide that can be
given, is to err on the side of overexposure rather than underexpose.</p>

<p>The carbon tissue being exposed, it is removed from the frame, and placed
in clean cold water; then as soon as it begins to uncurl itself, the copper plate
is placed in the water, and the two are brought into contact, the tissue adjusted
in position upon the copper, then removed from the water, and a squeegee
applied vigorously to the back of the tissue, applying the squeegee first one way
and then the other.</p>

<p>Now allow to stand a few minutes, then immerse it in water at a temperature
of 90° or 95°&nbsp;F., and in a few minutes the pigmented gelatine will begin to
ooze from under the paper backing, which may now be stripped off and thrown
away. The copper plate may now be raised and gently laved with the hot
water, or it may be allowed to remain until the whole of the soluble gelatine
is dissolved away, leaving the picture upon the copper plate, which is rinsed
in cold water and dried.</p>

<p>For the purpose of copper plate work, the image must be thoroughly well
exposed, every detail being impressed, else it will be impossible to get a good
photogravure; therefore, until the operator thoroughly understands the use of
the actinometer it will be as well to make a few prints upon a piece of opal
glass.</p>

<p>Carbon tissue does not keep in a sensitive condition more than a month,
under the most favorable conditions, the general time perhaps being a week.
The first sign of deterioration is generally shown when trying to mount
upon the copper, after soaking in cold water, the tissue refusing to adhere after
the application of the squeegee. The best way to test the sensitive tissue is to
take a small piece and immerse it in cold water for a minute, then put it into
water at 95°, and, if the coating dissolves off the paper the tissue is all right;
if it does not, it is useless. Tissue will generally be found at its best
about <span class="xxpn" id="p109">{109}</span>
three days after sensitizing, and will gain rapidly in sensitiveness daily afterward.</p>

of paper, grasp one end tightly and drag them rapidly through the tissue compound,
and directly they are lifted clear of the solution let an assistant grasp
the bottom and you dropping the top, will reverse the sheets and keep the
gelatine on the surface of the paper; when the gelatine has set, divide the two
sheets and hang up to dry; when dry the subsequent proceedings are the same
as for commercial tissue.</p>

<p>Flour of sulphur mixed with oil forms a good composition for etching

sulphur, if allowed to remain on the plate, will produce a flat tint, more or less
deep in proportion to the time it remains.</p>

<h5 title="Mordants For Zinc.">MORDANTS FOR ZINC.</h5>

<p>The comparative cheapness of zinc would give it
an advantage over copper or steel for engraving or
etching with the graver or point, but it does not
seem to be recommended for these purposes. It is
hard to cut with the graver, and, though it bites
easily, it is not suitable for fine work. Another
defect is that it will not stand a long impression;
but this may be overcome by surfacing the plate
with copper. The principal uses of this metal for
printing purposes are for surface printing or
zincography in the same manner as lithography,
and for the process of biting in relief, and
zinco-typography or Gillotage, now so largely
employed as a substitute for wood blocks. It can
also be engraved very delicately in the same style
as engraving is done on stone, through a coating of
gum.</p></div>

<p>The etching fluids for zinc are of two entirely
different kinds: first, mixtures of gum and weak
acids used for preparing plates for zincographic
printing in the lithographic press, or for
preliminary inking preparatory to being bitten in
relief by the Gillotage process; and secondly,
mineral acid, more or less dilute, used for biting
in relief and ordinary etching.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h6 title="Zincographic Etching."><i>Zincographic Etching.</i></h6>

<p>This kind of etching is more of a preparation of the plate for printing than
engraving or biting, the object being merely to fill up the pores of the metal
with gum, and prevent it receiving printers’ ink from the roller elsewhere than
on the lines of the drawing.</p></div>

<p>The solution most commonly employed for this purpose is a mixture of gum
and decoction of nut-galls, in use at the Ordnance Survey Office, Southampton,
and given by Sir Henry James in his work on <i>Photo-zincography</i>. It is prepared
as follows: Four ounces of Aleppo galls are bruised and steeped in three
quarts of cold water for twenty-four hours; the water and galls are then boiled
up together, and the decoction strained. The gum-water should be about the
consistency of cream. One quart of the decoction of galls is added to three
quarts of the gum-water and to the mixture are added about three ounces of
phosphoric acid, which is prepared by placing sticks of phosphorus in a
loosely corked bottle of water, so that the ends of the sticks may be uncovered.
The oxidation of the phosphorus produces phosphoric acid, which dissolves as
fast as it is formed. <span class="xxpn" id="p116">{116}</span></p>

<p>The etching solution should only just mark a piece of plain zinc.</p>

formula are given:</p>

<p>Richmond recommends, however, the use of a simple decoction of galls without
acid, and gumming in after etching.</p>

<p>Scamoni has the following, by Garnier: Boil about one and a half ounces of
bruised gall-nuts in a pint of water till reduced to one-third, filter, and add two
drops of nitric acid, and three or four drops of muriatic acid. For very fine
work this may be weakened with water. It is applied for about a minute,
then washed off, and the plate gummed.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">

<p>In biting zinc plates in relief, the acid generally used is nitric of different
degrees of strength, according to the nature and state of the work.</p></div>

<p>After the transfer is made, the plate is etched with one of the foregoing
preparations, then inked in and dusted with finely powdered resin, which
adheres only to the lines. This procedure is followed after every biting, the
plate being warmed to melt the resin and inky coating, so that it may run
down between the lines and protect them from the undercutting action of the
acid.</p>

<p>Kruger, in his <i>Die Zinkogravure</i>, recommends for the first relief etching,
nitric acid 30 to 40 drops to 100 grammes of water, applied for five minutes.
For each subsequent etching, 8 to 10 drops of acid are added for each 100
grammes of water, and the time is increased, from five to fifteen minutes. For
the final etching of the broad lights he uses:</p>

<p>Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7, as well as some others, are zinc etchings reproduced
from Mr. Mörch’s work. With them more effort has been made to secure
half-tone by a variety and quantity, or filling, in of lines. The example below
was made by using the objects (ferns) themselves as the negative, without any
interposition from photography, and shows one of the possible applications of
zinc etching. It is delicate work and is very beautiful when carefully done.
An example of true half-tone, obtained in the manner described in Part II., is
the one which follows. It was made by Mr. F. E. Ives, the earliest inventor
of a half-tone process, several years ago. The larger examples of half-tone
work which appear in this book are made after the most modern fashion and
formulæ, as described in Part II., and will serve well to show what the worker
in this fascinating process may expect to reach after patient and persistent
experiment. When we look upon Fig. 1 and see the very best that
zinc <span class="xxpn" id="p118">{118}</span>
etching could do a few years ago, and compare it with the Mosstype and other
half-tone pictures now possible, we may well wonder at the growth of the art.</p>

<p>It has been attained by the careful and persistent plodding of a few. Many
a method has been discarded for a newcomer, and there is no telling what may
come next. Photography has about revolutionized the illustration of books
and magazines, and has made the newspaper far more attractive than it was a
few years ago. It has made the faces of
almost every renowned individual familiar
in every land and in every household, and
the attractions of every known country
have been so pictured by it that every
intelligent child is familiar with them.
It has been said that process-engraving
has supplanted wood-engraving. This is
not so. How many newspapers were illustrated
before process-engraving was made
available? How many works of the old
masters and gems of the old museums
abroad were made familiar to the lovers of
pictures everywhere, by wood-engraving?
Instead of coming into the arts to take
the place of another, photo-engraving has
made a place for itself and a market for
itself. Moreover, it is refining and educating
the masses by creating a love for art,
where before its advent, there was very little feeling for the beautiful. Its
accomplishments have been marvellous, and yet they have hardly begun.
The good photography has done in bringing the wood-engraver up to his duty
in following the artist in every line and light and shade, it will augment by
teaching him how to secure the loveliest effects of nature. It will make way
for more wood-engraving as well as for more process-pictures if you choose to
call them such.</p>

<p>In printing from copper plates, the ink, instead of being spread on the surface
of the plate by means of a flexible roller as in ordinary type printing, is smeared
over the previously warmed plate and thereby forced into the deep parts of the
plate. Then, after the surface is polished, the paper picks out the ink from
these cavities and so forms the picture. Therefore, instead of using a negative
for producing the resist, a transparency is required; and for the production of
subjects in line, the transparency must fulfil all the conditions laid down as
required in a negative for the production of prints for zinc etching and for
photo-litho. transfers, and must be from a subject in line or in stipple.</p>

<p>The negative is made the exact size required, by the wet collodion process
(the lens being used without the reversing mirror). This negative is intensified
by immersion in the bichloride of mercury solution, and after well washing is
blackened by the application of ammonia, as directed in Part I. of this book,
under the head of photographic manipulation.</p>

<p>The negative must be varnished, and the margin outside the actual subject
required to be shown in the copper plate, must be masked by means of strips
of tin-foil cut perfectly straight and laid in position squarely and symmetrically.
The object is to make this margin appear in the transparency as perfectly
clear glass.</p>

<p>The masked negative is next placed in the carrier of the dark slide, film up;
then a couple of thicknesses of blotting paper about the eighth of an inch
square are laid on the extreme corners of the negative. Upon these pieces of
blotting paper a sensitive wet collodion plate is placed face down. The little
squares of blotting paper serve to prevent the sensitive plate from touching the
negative. <span class="xxpn" id="p120">{120}</span></p>

<p>The camera, with the lens out of focus, should be pointed to a large sheet of
white paper; insert the dark slide, draw the shutter, uncap the lens, and the
light reflected from the white sheet through the lens, through the negative upon
the sensitive plate, will result, after development, in a transparent positive of
the negative.</p>

<p>The time of exposure will, of course, vary and can only be found by experiment.
The operations of development, etc., are carried on as for a negative.</p>

<p>This method of making transparencies in the camera yields the best possible
results, as the rays of light are projected by the lens perfectly parallel, and the
resulting picture is far crisper than it is possible to obtain by exposing in the
ordinary manner.</p>

<p>If the negative to be reproduced is already made, and is larger than
required, mask the margin by means of the tin-foil, place it in the holder of
an enlarging camera, film towards the lens if the negative was made without a
mirror; but if the mirror was used and the negative is a reversed one, the film
must be placed away from the lens.</p>

<p>The camera is now adjusted so as to get the image the size required, then a
sensitive wet collodion plate is used to receive that image and produce the
transparency.</p>

<p>The transparency for printing upon a copper plate must, when laid upon a
piece of white paper, allow every detail, however minute, to be perfectly distinct
by reflected light. If this is not so it will be impossible to get a good
engraving on the copper plate.</p>

<p>The transparency being secured, a plate of highly polished copper is cleaned
with a little fine whiting and alcohol, then flooded with water. Take care
that all grease has been removed (which will be detected by the water running
in streaks); next wipe the plate carefully with a clean, soft cloth, and place it
in the jaws of the whirler mentioned in the chapter on the apparatus for zinc
printing. In the dark-room coat the copper plate with prepared bitumen (see
chapter on engraving on zinc in half-tone), and set the whirler in motion.
When the film of bitumen is dry, place it in contact with the transparency in
a printing frame, and expose it to the light (sunlight, if possible).</p>

<p>The time of exposure will depend very greatly upon the time of year and
day, but, in direct sunlight, ten to fifteen minutes will be about the time.</p>

<p>After exposure, the copper plate is removed from the frame, and placed in a
dish containing turpentine. Keep it rocking until the image is developed by
the unaltered bitumen being washed away, then remove the plate from the
dish, <span class="xxpn" id="p121">{121}</span>
and wash it well under the tap. When quite dry, coat the back and edges of
the copper with ordinary black varnish laid on with a camel’s-hair brush, so as
to prevent the mordant to be used from attacking the back.</p>

<p>Alterations and additions may now be made by means of transfer ink thinned
with turpentine, applied by a sable brush, or by means of an etching needle or
scraper, remembering that the etching needle or scraper will make a black line
and the transfer ink will cause a white mark, or exactly the reverse of a type
block. The plate is now ready for etching in a</p>

CHAPTER II. <span class="blksmaller">
HALF-TONE INTAGLIOS.</span></h3></div>

<p>We now come to quite a different class of work, namely, the production of
half-tone intaglio plates. They may be produced in many ways, each way
giving results quite unlike the others.</p>

<p>The first process is based on the half-tone method given for typographic
blocks, modified to suit intaglio.</p>

<p>In this, as in fact with
<span class="smmaj">ALL</span> methods, we must first of all produce a satisfactory
transparency. That is best done by reproducing in an enlarging
camera.</p>

<p>Place the negative, with the subject masked with tin-foil, in the window,
then focus upon the ground-glass screen of the camera the requisite size; then
prepare a wet collodion plate, and, having fixed a grained screen* in front of
the carrier, put the plate in its place, then expose to the light and develop as
directed for wet collodion pictures; the result, however, will be a positive and
not a negative, and instead of the grain being interspersed through the high
lights, the shadows will be grained.</p>

<div class="footnote" id="Footnote_6_6">

<p class="pfn">* The
grained screen is a copy from a proof from a fine ruled copper plate.
See Chapter on “Half-tone Blocks on Zinc.”</p></div>

<p>The transparency must be made in this manner—<i>i. e.</i>, from an ordinary
negative with a screen in front of the sensitive plate, so that the shadows and
half tones are grained or broken up. This would not be the case if the transparency
was made from a negative grained for the production of a type block,
as in such a negative the blacks are represented solid and the lights and half-tones
grained should be made on large sized plates.</p>

<p>The transparency made must fulfil all the conditions necessary for the production
of type blocks—<i>i. e.</i>, the film must be perfectly free from veil or fog;
it may be varnished or not.</p>

<p>The mark put upon the negative from which the transparency is made, will
cause the edges of the transparency to be quite clear. Coat a clean piece of
polished copper with the bitumen solution, using the whirler as
before; then <span class="xxpn" id="p123">{123}</span>
place the transparency in the printing frame, film up, and place the bitumen
coated copper plate in position, so that the image is quite in the centre of the
plate: fasten the printing frame and expose to the light.</p>

<p>The exposure will, of course, vary according to the strength of the light,
and should always, if possible, be made either in direct sunlight or by electric
arc light.</p>

<p>The development is effected by immersion in turpentine, and with the washing
and drying, has already been described.</p>

<p>The image on the copper plate being satisfactory, it may be retouched, if
necessary, then immersed in either of the etching fluids described in the last
chapter.</p>

<p>Rebiting, if necessary, may be done after rolling up with the resist ink there
given, but care must be taken in this rebiting to guard against interfering with
the grain of the plate.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="p124"
 title="Chapter III. Half-tone Intaglios—(Continued).">
CHAPTER III. <span class="blksmaller">
HALF-TONE INTAGLIOS—(<i>Continued</i>).</span></h3></div>

<p>The next process under consideration is that in which the grain is given to the
copper plate by dusting it with fine powder of resin (colophony) or of asphalt.
To do this a dusting box is required, which may be an ordinary aqua-tint box
hung on centres for the purpose of revolving it when desired to cover large
plates with the powder. The following figure will illustrate a box suitable
for small work.</p>

<div class="figleft imwth08" id="fig15">
<img src="images/i124.jpg" width="252" height="259" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 15.</div>
</div>

<p>The box should be eighteen inches high, twelve inches wide, and eight inches
deep; it may be made of cardboard with the inside quite smooth. It should
be closed all around except at A, where
there is a small door four inches high; the
bottom of the box is either studded with
small nails or some coarse wire netting is
stretched across, upon which the copper
plates can rest, as near level as possible.
To use this box, four ounces of resin or
asphalt are powdered in a mortar until
quite fine. The powder is placed inside
the box, and the door closed; the box is
now vigorously shaken, then placed on
the table, the door opened, and a copper
plate (previously cleaned and polished) is
at once placed face up on the nails or wire
netting. By the time the door is opened
and the copper plate or plates are in position, the coarser particles of the resin
will have subsided, leaving only the fine dust floating in the interior of the
box; now close the door, and leave the copper plate within until it is judged
that it is powdered sufficiently, which, of course, will be a matter for the
operator to find out by practice.</p>

<p>When the plate has been sufficiently powdered, it is carefully withdrawn
and placed upon a hot iron plate and allowed to remain there until the
resinous <span class="xxpn" id="p125">{125}</span>
powder is just sufficiently melted to adhere to the copper plate, preserving
as much as possible the separate existence of each atom of dust. Take care
to stop the action of the heat before the resin is melted completely and made
to run together and form a smooth surface.</p>

<p>The heat having acted long enough, carefully withdraw the prepared copper
from the hot plate and allow it to cool. Any desired quantity of these plates
may be prepared and stored away for future use. When they are required
the grain may be selected to suit each picture, as the operator can prepare at
will (after practice) either a coarse or a fine grained ground.</p>

<p>Instead of using a hot plate the resin may be melted over a gas flame, but
the hot plate will be found the best.</p>

<p>There is another method of laying this aquatint ground that is simple
and novel, viz., by using the air brush. Those who are in possession of
this instrument need no further instructions than to be reminded that ordinary
bitumen dissolved in benzole, or a resinous-spirit varnish, is placed in the
color reservoir, and then the brush will coat the clean copper plate with an
aquatint as fine or as coarse as required, according to the distance between
the plate and the “brush.” Another advantage with this method of laying
the ground is, the ground need not be even, as in the dusting method, but
the artist may lay the ground coarse in some places and fine in others,
<i>verb sap</i>.</p>

<p>The next step in this process will be to get a transparency of the subject.
This may be made by any known process (at last, some one says we are
getting away from the wet collodion) so long as it is clean, vigorous, and
free from fog.</p>

<p>The transparency being at hand, that portion of it required to be transferred
to the copper plate is carefully surrounded by a mask of tinfoil, or
of non-actinic paper, which will serve as a safe edge to the carbon tissue
to be used in making the negative resist, as well as to keep the margin of
the plate free from extraneous picture.</p>

<p>This done, a piece of sensitive carbon tissue, a little smaller than the
copper plate, which has been previously sensitized with bichromate of potash
and dried, is placed upon the masked transparency and exposed to light until
sufficiently printed; the tissue is then removed from the printing frame and
placed in a dish of clean cold water; then one of the copper plates with aquatinted
ground is also placed in the water, and the face of the tissue and the
copper plate are brought in contact. After adjusting the tissue on the
copper <span class="xxpn" id="p126">{126}</span>
plate, the two are withdrawn from the water, laid upon a bench, and a squeegee
passed over the back of the tissue. Thus the driving away of the water from
between the two surfaces will cause the tissue to adhere to the copper plate.</p>

<p>Now let the plate stand a few minutes, then immerse it in a dish of warm
water at about 90°&nbsp;F. As soon as the tissue compound is melted, lift away
the paper backing and throw it aside, then gently lave the copper plate with
the warm water until all the soluble pigmented gelatine is dissolved; after that
wash it under the tap, and place it in a strong solution of alum for fifteen minutes,
and again wash and allow to dry.</p>

<p>When the gelatine image on the copper plate is quite dry, the margin outside
the picture is coated with bitumen or spirit varnish, then the plate is placed
in the etching bath of perchloride of iron (see page
<a href="#p121" title="go to p. 121">121</a>), in which it is allowed
to remain until the high lights under the thickest portions of the gelatine image
just change color; then remove it and wash it under the tap; next clean off the
resist image, and after drying and cleaning up, try a proof. If necessary, ink
up as directed in Chapter I., page
<a href="#p121" title="go to p. 121">121,</a> and rebite.</p>

<p>To succeed with this process it is only requisite to have a well-laid ground,
a good, vigorous transparency, and the carbon tissue in good working order.</p>

working details of carbon printing, these will be given in a chapter further on,

 CHAPTER IV. <span class="blksmaller">
HALF-TONE INTAGLIOS. ELECTROTYPING METHODS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The preceding methods of obtaining intaglio plates have been by the etching
process. We now try another method whereby the printing plate is obtained
by depositing a film of copper upon the photograph, and from this
copper electrotype the prints are to be made.</p>

<p>There are many ways of proceeding to make these copper intaglios, the grain
being obtained in many ways, but the foundation is the same in all, and consists
of incorporating bichromated gelatine with grit of such a nature as to
cause the image to be rough instead of smooth, or else the roughness is given
to an ordinary or modified so-called carbon image developed upon a silvered
copper plate.</p>

<p>The silvered copper plates upon which the gelatine images are to be developed
are prepared by dipping clean polished plates in a solution of cyanide of
silver, made by adding cyanide of potassium solution to a solution of nitrate
of silver until there is a slight permanent precipitate. The copper plate remains
in this for three or four minutes; it is then removed, washed under the
tap, and dried.</p>

<p>The gelatine tissue compound is had by first of all making a jelly of</p>

<p>Soak the gelatine until soft, then melt it at as low a temperature as possible,
add the sugar and churn all for fifteen minutes; then add to one-half of the
jelly one ounce of finely powdered graphite, and to the other half one ounce
of a coarser powdered graphite. Churn these well together.</p>

<p>Paper is coated with the above mixtures, floating it first upon that containing
the coarser graphite, then after drying, coat again by floating the paper upon
the gelatine containing the fine graphite, and again drying.</p>

<p>The paper is then sensitized by being immersed in a three per cent. solution
of bichromate of potash. Dry it in the dark. After exposure to light
under <span class="xxpn" id="p128">{128}</span>
a <i>negative</i>, it is developed upon the silvered copper plate, after which the electro
is made.</p>

<p>Another plan is to expose a piece of ordinary carbon tissue under a negative in
the usual manner, then develop it upon the silvered copper plate, and sift over
the wet gelatine image some finely powdered glass, sand, or emery which has
been previously soaked in paraffine. The gelatine is then allowed to dry, when
the grit is brushed away, leaving the gelatine image all marked and pitted.
This pitted image is then black-leaded, and the electrotype is taken from it.</p>

<p>Another method is to place the newly developed carbon print on the copper
plate, inside the aqua-tint box, Chapter III. (having previously shaken up
the powder); when it is well dusted over, allow it to dry, and then remove
the powder by dissolving it out with either alcohol, turpentine, or benzole,
after which the electrotype is made.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" title="Part IV. Photo-lithography in Line."
id="p129">PART IV. <span class="blksmaller">
PHOTO-LITHOGRAPHY IN LINE.</span></h2>

<h3 class="nobreak" title="Chapter I.">CHAPTER I.</h3>
</div>

<p>This process is for making photographic reproductions of a subject in black
lines on a white ground, half-tones and shadings being indicated by hatching,
or stipple, but no washes of color are permissible. The object sought for from
such a subject is to produce a transfer which can be laid down upon stone or
zinc, and proofs printed therefrom in the ordinary lithographic press or
machine.</p>

<p>To gain this end there are three methods: the first, by printing upon paper
prepared with bichromated gelatine, the lines of which, after exposure to light
under a direct negative (<i>i.e.</i>, a negative taken without a mirror behind the
lens), will retain ink, whilst the gelatine protected from light absorbs water,
and rejects the ink. The result is a replica of the original in fatty ink, and
may be transferred to stone or zinc, and printed from by the usual lithographic
method.</p>

<p>In the second method, a print is made upon zinc from a reversed negative
(in the same manner as directed in Chapter V., Part I.) in bichromated albumen,
which is rolled up in transfer ink, and from that a transfer is pulled on
Scotch transfer paper, which may then be transferred to stone or zinc, and
printed from at a litho. press or machine.</p>

<p>In the third, and by far the best method, the print is made from a reversed
negative on zinc, in bitumen, as directed in Chapter V., Part I., then rolled
up in transfer ink, the transfer pulled on Scotch transfer paper, then transferred
to stone or zinc, and printed from at a litho. press or machine.</p>

<p>The defects inherent to the first method are, first of all, in the preparation
of the gelatine paper; this is tedious and messy. Then there is always danger
of breaking the lines in transferring, and also the difficulty of working exactly
to scale. <span class="xxpn" id="p130">{130}</span></p>

<p>The second method is quick, easy, and simple, the only drawback being a
tendency of the lines to thicken. With this and the third method there is no
difficulty in getting absolute scale.</p>

<p>The third method is perfect, and presents no drawbacks.</p>

<p>The two latter methods having been amply explained in Part I., it will not
be necessary to redescribe them, except to explain that when the print is made
on the zinc in albumen, it is gummed in, fanned dry, then damped off with a
wet sponge, followed by a damp cloth, rolled up with transfer ink, and the
transfer pulled upon good Scotch transfer paper.</p>

<p>The same remarks apply to bitumen prints.</p>

<p>For a transfer printed in bitumen, the image is developed in turpentine, and
when this is completed, wash the plate thoroughly under the tap, then immerse
it in the graining bath (Part I., Chapter I., page
<a href="#p024" title="go to p. 24">24</a>), and keep the tray
rocking for a few minutes; the effect of this will be to destroy the polished
surface of the metal, substituting a pearly matt surface, which will show up
the picture properly, and allow the operator to judge whether any of the fine
details are wanting; if there are, it will be necessary, if the details are dissolved
out, to repolish the zinc, first with pumice-stone, then with snake-stone, then
with pumice powder, finishing with fine rouge; then coat with bitumen, whirl,
and again expose to light, giving this time, longer exposure under the negative.</p>

<p>But if the fine details are buried in undissolved bitumen, a further immersion
in the turpentine bath will soon clear them; then again wash under the tap,
immerse in the graining bath, again wash, then, with a sheet of clean blotting
paper, remove the surplus water, and allow the surface to dry in a cold current;
but beware of using heat, as it has a tendency to make the bitumen image
refuse ink in rolling up.</p>

<p>The zinc being dry, it is gummed in, fanned dry, then the gum is washed
off, and the image rolled up with a leather roller charged with transfer ink.
As soon as the bitumen has taken the transfer ink all over, a transfer is pulled
upon Scotch transfer paper, which in turn is transferred to stone for printing
from.</p>

<p>In rolling up these prints upon zinc, care must be taken to keep the surface
(whether the image is in albumen or bitumen) properly damp.</p>

<p>The preparation of paper transfers will be treated upon in the next chapter.</p>

<p>The negative from which these transfers are made, must have all the characteristics
of a good negative for printing on zinc for etched blocks, viz., the
lines <span class="xxpn" id="p131">{131}</span>
must be represented by clear glass, and those portions of the negative representing
the whites of the original, must be as near opaque as possible.</p>

<p>The subjects to which photo-lithography is applicable, are those that are
strictly in line, or stipple, or dots, or cross hatched, or chalk drawings; in fact,
any subject that may be done by lithography, or in black and white; but no
shading by color washes is permissible.</p>

<p>Transferring to stone or zinc is done as follows:</p>

<p>First of all, the transfer is trimmed to proper size; it is then placed in a
damping book, made by placing wet sheets of brown or good printing paper
alternately with dry sheets, then placing all under a weight for a few hours,
until the whole of the book is evenly damp; the trimmed transfer is allowed
to remain here until limp; it is then sponged on the back with a very little of
oxalic acid (half an ounce), water eighty ounces; now lay the transfer carefully
down on a perfectly clean and polished stone, backing the transfer with a piece
of smooth paper. Having adjusted the pressure of the scraper on the stone,
pull through twice, then reverse the stone in the press, and pull through twice
more. Then remove the backing and lift the transfer from the stone, when
the whole of the ink should be upon the stone, leaving the paper quite clean.
Now, if the picture is quite satisfactory, wipe the stone first with a wet sponge,
then with a damp cloth, then gum in and allow to dry, and, if possible, to stand
with the gum on all night.</p>

with a glass rod) one drachm of a ten-grain solution of chrome alum. Now
strain the gelatine solution through fine muslin into a clean dish, standing it in
a larger dish containing hot water; float the bank post paper upon this solution
(taking care to avoid air-bubbles) for two minutes, then lift it off slowly and
hang it up to dry, pinning it by two corners to the edge of a shelf.</p>

<p>When dry, the operation is repeated, but this time the paper is hung up to
dry by the two opposite corners, so as to equalize the coat of gelatine.</p>

<p>When dry a second time, it must be floated for two minutes upon</p>

<p>This being done, the paper is again hung up to dry, this time in a dark room.</p>

<p>When dry, the paper should be laid face down, upon a polished litho. stone,
and be pulled through the press three or four times, so as to get the surface as
smooth as possible, and insure absolute contact. <span class="xxpn" id="p133">{133}</span></p>

<p>This must be done in a yellow light, or in a room lighted by gas or oil light.</p>

<p>The paper is now placed in contact with the negative, in a printing-frame,
and exposed to light; the exposure for such paper should be from five to fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p>Note well that these paper transfers are printed from negatives taken direct
in the camera, without the intervention of the mirror, therefore negatives suitable
for printing paper transfers will not do for printing upon zinc, or <i>vice
versa.</i></p>

<p>The progress may be watched by undoing one side of the back of the frame,
and examining the image in the dark room; but in damp weather this should
not be done too often, as the paper may expand or contract, and blur the
image.</p>

<p>The exposure to light under the negative being complete, the print is
removed from the frame in the dark room, and is next coated with a thin film
of ink as follows:</p>

<p>A smooth litho. stone is carefully coated with a fatty ink by means of a
leather roller, extreme care being necessary to insure an even coat of ink over
the stone; this being attained, the exposed print is laid face down (the room
being lit by yellow light or gaslight) upon the inked stone, then a piece of
backing paper laid upon it, and pulled through the press, with a good nip upon
it; pull it through twice, then reverse the stone on the press, and again pull
through twice, which will leave a fine, thin film of ink upon it. Now take the
inked print, and place it in a tray of clean, cold water, allow it to remain
therein for five minutes, then lay the print upon a piece of glass, and rub it
gently with a pad of cotton-wool—previously wetted in the water. This will
remove the ink from those portions of the paper that were protected from the
action of light by the opaque portions of the negative, representing the whites
of the original.</p>

<p>The application of the pad of cotton-wool is continued until the whole of the
picture is cleared from superfluous ink, and the lines composing the image are
evenly coated with ink. The ink adheres only to those portions of the paper
which the light has acted upon, through the negative.</p>

<p>Now wash the transfer under the tap, then hang it up to dry. When dry
it is ready for transferring to stone or zinc.</p>

<p>To transfer to stone or zinc, place the transfer first of all in the damping
book, and when limp place it upon a clean, cold, polished stone, and pull it
through the press. <span class="xxpn" id="p134">{134}</span></p>

<p>When transferred, the image is treated in exactly the same manner as an
ordinary transfer on stone or zinc.</p>

<p>Paper thus prepared must be kept in a dry air-tight case, and just before
using is laid face down upon a smooth litho. stone, and pulled through the
litho. press. After this, it is placed in contact with the negative in the printing
frame, and exposed to light until the details are visible. Although the
progress of the action of light can be seen, the frame must not be opened too
often, or the paper is apt to expand and blur the image. After exposure the
print is inked up, developed, and treated exactly as explained above.</p>

<p>The ink suitable for inking up the stone, previous to laying upon it the exposed
print, is composed of</p>

<p>Put the ink and fat into a small iron or earthenware pot, and place it over a
Bunsen burner, or a paraffine stove, or on the hot plate of a kitchen stove
(<i>but not over an open fire</i>); allow the heat to melt the two ingredients, stir
so as to incorporate them thoroughly; take great care not to allow it to catch
fire; if it does, at once extinguish the flame, as the firing would be apt to spoil
the ink. When thoroughly melted and incorporated, pour into a tin, or pot, for
use when cool; the time occupied in making this ink will not exceed twenty
minutes. The mutton fat is obtained by dropping solid kidney suet (shredded)
into a pan of clean boiling water, then allowing to cool, when the fat is taken
off the surface of the water, freed from damp and stored for use.</p>

<p>Another formula for the preparation of paper, to be inked up, after printing
in the same manner as the above transfers, is to coat paper twice with the following
preparation, drying between each coat: arrowroot, 1 ounce; wet this
thoroughly with 5 ounces of cold water, stirring well with a spatula, adding
more cold water, if necessary, to moisten the lot; then pour over it 20 ounces
of boiling water, stirring all the time; if, when the 20 ounces are
added, <span class="xxpn" id="p135">{135}</span>
the arrowroot has not thickened, add more boiling water until it does do so;
now add <sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#8260;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>
an ounce of powdered bichromate of potash and stir until dissolved;
then strain through muslin into a warm dish and float the paper upon it
whilst hot, and dry at a temperature of 70°&nbsp;F.</p>

<p>If the bichromate of potash be omitted, the paper may be prepared in quantity
and stored away for future use, being made sensitive by floating for five

<p>Paper for either gelatine or arrowroot transfers, after keeping so long after
preparation as to be useless, should not be thrown away, but should be again

finer results than new paper.</p>

<p>Soak the gelatine in the water (cold) until quite soft, then melt it by the
application of heat (nothing is better for this sort of work than a <i>Bain Marie</i>,
a domestic utensil with a porcelain pan enclosed in one of tin); then add the
sugar and stir well, continuing the application of heat until a temperature of
150°&nbsp;F. has been reached; now strain the gelatine through muslin, into a clean
dish placed in a larger dish containing boiling water, the heat from which
will keep the solution of gelatine in a properly liquid state during the operation
of coating the paper.</p>

<p>The best for these transfers is a good hand-made writing paper, or good bank-post.</p>

<p>Cut the paper into suitable sizes, leaving a little extra margin at one end,
and float it upon the hot gelatine solution as above; be careful in laying the
paper upon the gelatine, that air bells are avoided; when the sheet is laid upon
the surface, raise it rapidly, and throw it at once over a cylinder of cardboard
or of wood, and at once commence to revolve this cylinder rapidly, first in one
direction, and as the limit of the length of paper is reached, revolve it in the
other, which motion will alternately bring first one end uppermost and then
the other. By this means an even coating of gelatine upon the paper is
secured, which is not possible when the paper is hung up by clips directly it is
taken from the surface of the hot gelatine. The cylinder is kept revolving
until the gelatine has set, when it may be hung up to dry upon clips, or laid
face up, over a line upon a piece of cardboard; during the operation of revolving
the cylinder, any air bells formed in the gelatine coating may be
removed by blowing or pricking them.</p>

<p>This, to my mind, is a most elegant method of coating small sheets (up to
thirty inches long) with a coat of gelatine, for which I willingly give
the <span class="xxpn" id="p137">{137}</span>
Royal Engineers the credit, it having been demonstrated to me by Ex-sergeant
Dalton, of that corps.</p>

<p>Paper coated in this manner, when dry, is ready for sensitizing; but if coated
in the ordinary manner, it should, when dry, be coated a second time and hung
up to dry in the opposite way that it was the first time.</p>

<p>Paper coated with gelatine solution as above, may be stocked, as the coating
does not deteriorate with time; but the operator must be careful not to allow
the solution of gelatine to get below 125° during coating, else the surface will
be sticky. The temperature of the drying room must not exceed 70°, in fact,
60° will be best.</p>

<p>Paper so coated is sensitized by immersion for three minutes in</p>

<p class="pcontinue">In hot weather this solution must be kept cool with ice.</p>

<p>When the time of immersion has expired the paper is removed, and laid
face down upon a sheet of glass free from scratches—which sheet of glass has
been well polished with finely powdered talc (or French chalk)—now squeegee
the back of the paper vigorously, to remove the superfluous solution and bring
the surface of the paper into absolute contact with the glass plate. The sheet of
glass is now placed in a rack, in the dark room, until the paper is quite dry,
when it may be readily stripped off the glass, and is ready for printing the
transfer. The operation of drying should be done in a current of air at a temperature
of about 60°, and the paper must be quite dry before attempting to
strip it from the glass.</p>

<p>The exposure under the negative is the same as described in the previous
chapter.</p>

<p>When sufficiently exposed, the print is removed from the frame in the dark
room, and at once immersed in cold water, where it is allowed to stay for five
minutes, when it is withdrawn and laid upon a piece of plate glass, or a zinc
plate, the face being uppermost; then the loose end of the paper (provision for
which must be made in cutting the paper) is tucked under the plate, so as to
hold the transfer in position in the subsequent operations.</p>

<p>Now take a glue roller (the same as used for inking up the albumen image
on zinc, described in Part I., Chapter IV.), and having spread a little of the
ink described in the last chapter (chalk, litho. ink, and mutton fat) upon the
slab, charge the roller carefully with a thin coating of ink, and then,
having <span class="xxpn" id="p138">{138}</span>
removed any moisture from the face of the transfer with a soft sponge, apply
the inked glue roller, rolling one way only—<i>i.e.</i>, from the body (presuming
that the edge of paper tucked under the slab is next the body of the operator);
continue rolling until the whole of the lines forming the picture are coated with
ink, and the whites quite clean and free from ink. If the roller should get
wet from water oozing from under the transfer, wipe it with a damp cloth and
then roll it a few times on the inking slab, and continue rolling the transfer.
Be careful that the portion of the transfer representing the whites of the
picture has absorbed its full modicum of water before beginning to roll up, and
also that there is not too much ink upon the roller. When the transfer is successfully
inked up, it is hung up to dry, and when dry is trimmed to size,
placed in a damping book, and transferred to stone.</p>

<p>The exposed transfer, after wetting, and being placed upon the plate of glass,
or zinc, may be developed in another way. First remove the superfluous water
from the surface with a soft damp sponge, then rub it gently all over with a
pad of cotton-wool dipped in a thin mixture of ink thinned with turpentine
and well mixed with a palette knife (this ink should be a little thicker than
ordinary copying ink); all the image must be covered with the ink. The turpentine
is then allowed to evaporate, when by rolling with the glue roller from
the body, the ink will clear away from the whites, leaving the lines sharp and
distinct. Do not use too much pressure, else the ink may be removed from
the lines, in which case cover the whole picture with a fresh coat of the thin
ink, and again roll off. The subsequent operations are the same as for the
other paper transfers.</p>

<p>The ink for this method is made by melting over a Bunsen burner, or
paraffine stove,</p>

exercised to keep the paper from being exposed to the action of light, before

<p>This is dried in the dark, then exposed to light in a printing frame under a
direct negative. It is then laid, face down, upon a polished zinc or stone, if a
line subject, or on a grained zinc or stone, if a half-tone subject; upon the back
of the print several sheets of damp paper are laid, and then the whole is subjected
to very heavy pressure in a hydraulic press, so that the water in the
damp paper may be forced through the print and dissolve the gum in the unexposed
parts of the sensitive gum coating (which is still soluble). The dissolved
gum attaches itself to the stone, whilst the exposed parts being rendered
insoluble by the action of light, the damp has no effect upon it, and the stone
is protected in those parts.</p>

<p>When the stone has been under pressure for a sufficient length of time, to
allow the small traces of gum in the deepest shadows to attach themselves to
the stone, the pressure is removed, the stone withdrawn, and the paper carrying
the photographic print is carefully lifted up, leaving the bare negative image
on a gummed ground. The stone is well dried, and covered all over with a
greasy ink applied by a roller or otherwise. The ink is thus brought into contact
with all parts of the stone or zinc unprotected by the gum.</p>

<p>The image is then washed out with turpentine, and the gum removed by a
damp sponge, after which the stone or zinc is rolled up in the ordinary manner
with a leather roller, and is printed from in the ordinary manner.</p>

<p>Of course, it will not be expected that the best results are obtainable by so
simple a process. Perhaps in no other branch of work does an outlay of
thought and time “pay” so well as in the practice of these interesting photo-printing
methods.</p>

<div class="divp"><h5 class="hinline" title="To develop photo-litho.
transfers on paper"><i>To develop photo-litho.
transfers on paper</i></h5>
there are two methods. The first
and oldest is, after exposure, to coat a smooth litho. stone with a thin layer of
transfer ink, by means of a leather roller, then to lay the exposed print face
down upon this inked stone, and pull it through the press. Of course, this
must be done in a dark room, or by gas or oil light, as daylight would spoil
the transfer.</div>

<p>Now the inked and exposed transfer is placed in water at 80°&nbsp;F., and
allowed to remain for three or four minutes, when it is taken from the water
and placed upon a plate of glass, and the superfluous ink is removed by means
of a sponge dipped in the hot water. If the negative has been sufficiently
opaque, and the exposure right, the image will quickly develop, the lines
retaining the ink, while that upon the whites will come away.</p>

<p>Hot water is used where the coating is of gelatine only; if gum arabic,
or albumen has been used, then, after inking up on the stone, the transfer must
be developed in cold water, and cotton-wool used to remove the ink from the
whites, rubbing very carefully with very little pressure.</p>

<p>Paper prepared with a thick coat of gelatine may be developed in another
way; after removing it from the printing-frame, the transfer is inked up on
the stone, then placed in a dish of cold water and left there for five or ten
minutes; then removed and placed upon a thick glass slab, the end tucked
under so that when placed on the bench the slab will press the paper and keep
it in position. Now, with a sheet of clean blotting-paper, remove the water
from the transfer, using pressure with the hands from the end tucked under
the slab; then, with a glue roller, roll from the tucked under end until the
image is developed. Instead of inking the transfer up when dry, the transfer
may be placed in the cold water directly it is taken from the printing-frame,
and allowed to remain for ten or fifteen minutes, during which time the image
will swell, by the whites absorbing water. Now place upon the glass slab
(one end being tucked under), and remove the superfluous water first with
a <span class="xxpn" id="p141">{141}</span>
sponge, then with a damp cloth; now dip a sponge in transfer ink thinned to
the consistency of cream by turpentine, and dab all over the damp transfer,
then allow it to stand until the turpentine has evaporated. Next take the
glue roller and roll the transfer until the whites are clear; only roll one
way—<i>i.e.</i>, from the end tucked under the slab.</p>

<p>The transfers being developed, they are rinsed with clean water, and hung
up to dry in a current of cool air.
If dried at too high a temperature,
the transfers will be inferior, and difficult
to handle.</p>

<img src="images/i141.jpg" width="312" height="214" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 16.</div>
</div>

<p>Instead of using a slab of glass,
and tucking the end of the transfer
under­neath, a pro­per de­vel­o­ping-board
may be used as follows: A is
a clamped board 18 inches by 12
inches, by 1 inch thick; B is another
4 inches by 12 inches; these are
hinged together at C, the hinges
being let into the boards un­der­neath. Now, if the trans­fer be laid upon the
board A, the end placed in the aper­ture C, then the pres­sure of the rol­ler will
cause the piece B to clamp the paper quite tight.</p>

<p>A few lit­tle dif­fer­ences in ma­nip­u­la­tion are re­quired by the various trans­fer
papers found on sale in the market. For this reason I add the ins­truc­tions
given by Prof. Husnik for his transfer paper.</p>

<div class="divp"><h5 class="hinline" title="Making the paper
sensitive."><i>Making the paper sensitive.</i></h5>—Pour
the solution in a shallow glass or porcelain
dish (such as photographers use), take hold of the paper on two opposite ends,
dip one end (prepared side <i>upward</i>) in the solution, and draw the paper through
so that the whole surface is covered evenly with the solution; drain off and
hang it up for drying in a <i>dark</i> room. Pins may be used for this purpose.
Never <i>reverse</i> the paper in hanging it up. Wet only as much of the paper as
you intend using at every one occasion. In hot summer weather the so prepared
paper must be used within a few hours. In cold and damp weather it
keeps good for three days. After the paper has passed through the bath the
<i>prepared side</i> of it must not be brought in contact with anything whatever, as
the least touch will create a spot in the picture. For pouring back the solution
into the bottle use a glass funnel. It is very advisable to run the
sensitive <span class="xxpn" id="p142">{142}</span>
paper on a polished stone or metal plate through a lithograph press to give a
smooth surface.</div>

<div class="divp">
<h5 class="hinline" title="The Development."><i>The development</i></h5> of the picture can begin after the mentioned time and is to
be accomplished with a fine, solid, and very soft sponge, rubbing in circle-form
with it over all parts of the picture until all the ink is washed out of the lights,
the lines becoming clear and distinct and the shade properly open. The water
must be changed several times, passing always with the sponge delicately over
all parts of the picture to remove all uncleanliness from it. But never go over
the picture with a dry sponge. After washing the picture clean it is laid
between damp printing paper and slightly pressed with the hands to remove

PHOTO-LITHOGRAPHY IN HALF-TONE.</span></h2>

<h3 class="nobreak" title="Chapter I.">CHAPTER I.</h3></div>

<p>This process, like photo-engraving, has been the subject of many applications
to the Patent Office, but the first notable progress was made by Messrs.
Bullock, in 1865. They seem to have gone into the subject thoroughly, as
the elaborate and practical specifications prove, but although the patentees
issued some fine specimens of their work, and advertised the sale of prepared
paper, nothing came of it.</p>

<p>Messrs. Bullock’s method comprises the printing from grained stone tile, or
a stone upon which has been laid a transfer, from a stipple plate, or a plate
engraved in lines or dots—upon sensitive transfer paper in stiff ink.</p>

<p>The sensitive paper, with such imprint upon it, is exposed to light under a
negative, the specks of ink forming a medium for breaking up the half-tones.</p>

<p>Suitable grain may be obtained from machine stippled plates, as well as
from grained stone.</p>

<p>Half-tone photo-lithography may also be made by making, from a proof
pulled from a machine stipple, or a ruled plate, or a grained stone, a wet, collodion
negative, which, being stripped from its glass support (by any of the
means mentioned in the chapter on stripped films) is placed between the ordinary
half-tone negative and the sensitive surface—zinc, coated with bichromated
albumen, or with bitumen, or either of the transfer papers treated of in Part
IV.—the result will be a grained transfer.</p>

<p>Grained zinc, coated with bichromated albumen, or with bitumen, and
exposed under a very thin half-tone negative, will also yield transfers suitable
for a good many subjects, but the most successful methods are modifications of
the collographic printing processes.</p>

<p>Transfers made by any of the methods mentioned in the following chapters
may be transferred to polished zinc, and then etched in relief, as directed in
Part I.</p>

INK PHOTOS.</span></h3></div>

<p>The various methods named in the last chapter for breaking up and transferring
to stone the delicate half tints of a photograph from nature, are in a
great measure rather crude and do not give the fine results yielded by the following
modification of the collotype process, nor are they so certain and simple
in their working.</p>

<p>The production of ink photos is as follows: A plate of flat copper is grained
by means of graining sand and a piece of litho. stone, the sand being put through
a fine sieve (about 120 holes to the inch). The copper plate being, first of all,
well polished and without scratches, is placed upon a flat board, the graining
sand is then sieved over it, and moistened, then with a light, firm motion of
the wrist, the whole of the surface is evenly ground. The operation of graining
is very difficult to describe, except to say that the stone muller is shuffled all
over the plate until the polished surface of the copper is replaced by an even
matt. Renew the sand when necessary. Do not try to get through the operation
rapidly by taking large circles, else scratches are sure to result.</p>

<p>The copper plate being grained, it is well washed, back and front, so as to
free it from all grit, then coated whilst wet with</p>

<p>Warm the coated copper plates by letting them lie upon the slab of the
drying oven. The drying oven is described in the chapter on collotype
printing, and for this process the slab should be at about a temperature of
150°&nbsp;F. Now strain the above mixture through muslin into an invalid’s cup
with a long spout, and holding the warm copper plate horizontally on the palm
of the left hand, proceed to pour over it as much of the gelatine mixture as will
well cover it. Do not have a very thick film, else the grain will be too coarse;
nor too thin, or there will be no grain at all. Practice will soon enable the
operator to apportion the proper quantity to each plate. As a rough estimate,
about one fluidounce of the mixture for a plate 12 × 10 will be required.</p>

<p>The plate being coated, it is placed on the slab of the drying oven and left
there until dry. That will take from one and a half to two hours. The exact
temperature at which to dry these films cannot be arbitrarily stated, as so much
will depend upon the picture which is to be printed; therefore, a few experiments
will be necessary before settling down to an exact form of working. A good
plan that answers admirably is to raise the water in the tank of the drying
oven to boiling point before coating the plate, then coat the plate, lay it on
the slab, let the water in the tank boil for a few minutes then turn out the gas
and let the plate dry.</p>

<p>The plate being dry it is exposed under a good ordinary (reversed) negative
until the whole of the details are well out. Time the exposure by means of
an actinometer.</p>

<p>After exposure under the negative, remove the plate from the printing frame
and in the dark room cover it with litho. transfer ink by means of a leather
roller, taking care that the whole of the surface is well coated with the ink.
Now place it in clean cold water for three or four hours, then with a
soft <span class="xxpn" id="p146">{146}</span>
sponge remove as much of the ink as will come away. This operation will
take time, as every care must be had not to scratch the film.</p>

<p>Now rinse the plate under the tap and allow it to dry.</p>

<p>When dry soak it in cold water for half an hour, then place it on the press
(an ordinary letter press), and with a sponge and soft cloth remove the superfluous
water from the film; then roll up with a leather roller charged with
litho. transfer ink as thick as can be worked. When the image is properly
inked up pull a transfer upon good Scotch transfer paper.</p>

<p>Perhaps the first two or three pulls will not be satisfactory; therefore, it will
be best to pull a few before using the transfer paper, damping and wiping
between each pull just in the same way that is done in printing from a lithographic
stone.</p>

<p>A good transfer being obtained, it should be given to a lithographer to put
it down upon a grained stone, an operation which requires great skill and experience.
The student’s interest will be best consulted by not attempting to
give a description of how to transfer to a grained stone.</p>

 title="Chapter III. Husband’s Papyrotint Process.">
CHAPTER III. <span class="blksmaller">
HUSBAND’S PAPYROTINT PROCESS.</span></h3></div>

<p>This is a process for the production of photo-lithography in half-tone, direct
from the negative, without the intervention of a collotype plate from which to
pull the transfer, and is a distinct step in advance.</p>

<p>This process has been named papyrotint, being a modification of Captain
Abney’s improved method of photo-lithography, named papyrotype. It is
specially adapted to the reproduction of subjects in half-tone, such as architectural
drawings in monochrome, or subjects from nature, and it is inexpensive.
Its advantages over other methods of half-tone photo-lithography are, that a
transfer can be taken in greasy ink, for transfer to stone or zinc <i>direct</i> from
any negative, however large, without the aid of a medium, the grain or reticulation
being obtained simply by a chemical change. The transfer paper being
in direct contact with the negative, the resulting prints are sharper than by
those processes where interposed media are used; whilst the same negative will
answer either for a silver print, platinotype, or a transfer for zinc or stone. The
advantage of being able to use a non-reversed negative is very great, now that
gelatine plates have so largely superseded those made with collodion.</p>

<p>The method of manipulation is as follows: Any good surface paper is floated
twice on a bath composed of</p>

<p>Great care should be taken that the solution is not overheated, and that the
paper is coated without bubbles. It is then dried in a temperature of 60°&nbsp;F.
The paper will take about ten hours to dry, and in this state will keep
for years. When required for use, it should be sensitized by floating on, or
immersing in, a bath of</p>

<p>This need not be done in a dark-room, as the solution is not sensitive to
light.</p>

<p>The paper, after sensitizing, is dried in a temperature of 70°, and in a
dark room. When dry, it is exposed under any half-tone negative, in
the ordinary printing frame. It is preferable to print in sunlight, and, for
negatives of medium density, an exposure of three minutes is required; but
the exposure will vary according to the density of the negative. The correct
time of exposure can best be judged by looking at the print in the frame.
When the image appears on the transfer paper of a dark fawn color, on a
yellow ground, the transfer is sufficiently printed. It is put into a bath of
cold water for about ten minutes, until the soluble gelatine has taken up its full
quantity of water; then taken out, placed upon a flat piece of stone, glass, or
zinc plate, and the surface dried with blotting paper.</p>

<p>The action of the light has been to render the parts to which it has penetrated
through the negative partly insoluble, and at the same time granulated.
A hard transfer ink is now used, composed of</p>

<p>These are melted together in a crucible over a small gas-jet, and to them are
added four ounces of chalk printing ink, and the mixture reduced to the consistency
of cream with spirits of turpentine. A soft sponge is saturated with
this mixture and rubbed gently over the exposed paper (in this stage the nature
of the grain can be best seen). An ordinary letter-press roller, charged with a
little ink from the inking slab, is then passed over the transfer, causing the ink
to adhere firmly to the parts affected by the light, and removing it from the
parts unacted upon. It will be found that with practice, rolling slowly and
carefully as a letter-press printer would his form, the ink will be removed by
the roller according to the action that has taken place by light, leaving the
shadows fully charged with ink, and the high lights almost clear, the result
being a grained transfer in greasy ink. The transfer is next put into a weak
bath of tannin and bichromate of potash for a few minutes, and when taken
out the surplus solution should be carefully dried off between clean sheets of
blotting paper. The transfer is hung up to dry, and when thoroughly dry,
the whole of the still sensitive surface should be exposed to light for about two
minutes. A weak solution of oxalic acid should be used for damping
the <span class="xxpn" id="p149">{149}</span>
transfer (about 1 in 100), and this should be applied to the back of the transfer
with a soft sponge. After it has been damped about four times, it should be
carefully put between clean sheets of blotting paper, and the surplus moisture
removed. A cold polished stone is then set on the press, and when everything
is ready the transfer is placed on the stone and pulled through twice. The
stone or scraper is then reversed, and the transfer is again twice pulled through.
A moderate pressure and a hard backing sheet should be used, care being taken
not to increase the pressure after the first pull through. The transfer is taken
from the stone without damping, when it will be found that the ink has left
the paper clean. Gum up the stone in the usual way, but, if possible, let the
transfer remain a few hours before rolling up. Do not wash it out with
turpentine, and use middle varnish to thin down the ink.</p>

<p>It should have been mentioned that varying degrees of fineness of grain can
be given to the transfer by adding a little more ferridcyanide of potassium in
the sensitizing solution, and drying the transfer paper at a higher temperature,
or by heating the paper a little before exposure, or by adding a little hot water
to the cold water bath, after the transfer has been fully exposed; the higher
the temperature of the water, the coarser the grain will be. The finer grain
is best suited to negatives from Nature, when a considerable amount of detail
has to be shown.</p>

<p>The coarse grain is best for subjects in monochrome, or large negatives from
Nature, of architecture, etc., where the detail is not so small. Even from the
finer grain, several hundred copies can be pulled, as many as 1200 having
been pulled from a single transfer. It would have produced a great many
more if required.</p>

CHAPTER I. <span class="blksmaller">
HALF-TONE PHOTOGRAPHIC NEGATIVES.</span></h3></div>

<p>In all the processes and methods treated of up to Part III., the photographic
negative has been what may properly be termed, a black and white negative,
the lines being rendered clear, and the portions representing the whites of the
original being as near black as possible. The extremes of clearness and opacity
in these negatives are obtained by having the nitrate of silver bath kept and
worked in a very acid state; then the opacity is obtained by intensifying with
a solution of mercury followed by ammonia.</p>

<p>Now for the methods to be treated of in this part. An entirely different
class of negative is required in which the half-tones are fully preserved, both
in the shadows, and in the lights. These half-tone negatives may be made
either by the wet collodion process, or upon ordinary gelatine dry plates. For
producing them by the wet collodion process, directions are given on
page <a href="#p011" title="go to p. 11">11.</a></p>

<p>In the processes treated in Part II. the aim has been to get the photographic
half-tone broken up in such a manner that the picture could be reproduced by
the same means as an ordinary wood block, but in collographic printing the
half-tones are not (visibly) broken up, the gelatine holding the ink in exact
proportion to its exposure to light, thereby giving a print with the smooth
gradations of an ordinary photograph.</p>

<p>The collographic methods are called “heliotype” and collotype. They are
analogous in principle, but differ in detail; the heliotype is printed from a film
of gelatine, which, after being dried upon a plate of glass, is stripped off,
exposed to light under a reversed negative, then mounted upon a plate of
pewter to support it during the operation of printing from. The collotype
printing surface is the film of gelatine upon the glass or metal plate upon
which it was dried. Note also the different printing
methods.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="p152"
 title="Chapter II. The Heliotype Process.">
CHAPTER II. <span class="blksmaller">
THE HELIOTYPE PROCESS.</span></h3></div>

<p>A heliotype print is made in an Albion or other type-printing press, from
a film or skin of bichromated gelatine, which, having been dried upon a plate
glass (finely ground and waxed), is stripped off, then exposed to light in an
ordinary printing-frame, under a reversed negative, then removed from the
frame, laid face down upon a piece of black velvet, and the back of the skin
exposed to light for a short time. The skin is next mounted upon a pewter
plate, coated with a thin film of India-rubber, and placed upon the bed of the
press, where the skin is covered with water from a sponge, and is allowed to
soak for twenty or thirty minutes. It is then inked up, first with one roller,
and then with another of a slightly different composition; the margin of the
skin is then covered with a mask, with a suitable opening cut in it, then the
paper that is to receive the image is put into position upon the mask. The
picture is then printed.</p>

<p>The above is a rough outline of the process; now for the working details.</p>

<p>First of all, it will be necessary to understand that the gelatine skin from
which the picture is printed must be of such a size as to allow a margin outside
the actual picture of at least two inches all around, so that the rollers used in
inking up will not overlap the margin, and strip the skin away from the
pewter plate upon which it is mounted. For pictures 10 by 12, and under, a
convenient size for the heliotype skin will be 21 inches by 15 inches, so the
present chapter will treat entirely of skins 22 by 16, and the sizes of rollers,
etc., given, as well as formulas for quantities of gelatine, etc., will be those most
suitable for that size of skin; so if larger skins are adopted, the quantities here
given must be modified accordingly.</p>

<p>The first consideration will be the apparatus and materials necessary. The
first thing that commands attention is the press—an Albion or other typographic
hand press—(the pressure necessary to print from a heliotype skin must
be vertical, not scraping, therefore a lithographic press will not do). The
press must have the bed fitted with several thicknesses of Kamptulican sufficient
to <i>nearly</i> bring a sheet of thick zinc type high—“nearly” is said,
because <span class="xxpn" id="p153">{153}</span>
due allowance must be made for the pewter plate (one-eighth of an inch in
thickness) upon which the heliotype skin is mounted. Inside the tympan
place a piece of good blanket, and also provide a loose blanket to lay over the
paper when placed in position for receiving the impression.</p>

<p>The press must be fastened down to the floor, as plenty of pressure will be
required in printing; a bench will be required close to the press, upon which
either one large inking slab or two small ones can be placed, as well as the
stock of printing papers, and a dish of water. A couple of good sponges are
also required, as well as a supply of thick plate paper, to blot off the superfluous
water.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="The Rollers.">THE ROLLERS.</h4>

<p>The quality of the print from a heliotype skin depends greatly upon having
good rollers at hand for inking the image; therefore, the preparation of the
rollers (two) must be made with every care. Get the usual printing office pattern,
with handles in the centre. The stocks of these rollers are to be coated with
India-rubber sponge, upon which is cast a mixture of gelatine, etc.</p></div>

<p>First of all, procure two 12-inch rollers with handles complete, and get the
stocks coated with India-rubber sponge a quarter of an inch thick; then, with
strong twine tie down about a quarter of an inch from each end, trimming off
the edges outside the string, so as to make them nice and round; now place
one of the stocks in position upon the base socket of a 15-inch seamless roller
mould, then carefully smear the inside of the mould with a rag saturated with
whale oil (taking care that the whole of the surface of the mould is smeared
with the oil); now place the mould in position over the stock, put the loose
socket in position at the top, when it is ready for receiving the composition for
the inking roller, made as follows—</p>

green treacle, mix, and add 2 ounces of castor oil, 1 ounce of glycerine; stir
well until all are thoroughly mixed, then pour into a warm jug, and from the
jug pour into the mould as gently as possible; when the mould is full, take a
piece of wood, and tap the outside of the mould all round, from bottom to top.
That will cause any air bubbles that may be imprisoned in the mixture to
rise <span class="xxpn" id="p154">{154}</span>
to the surface; then, if the mixture in setting should shrink, pour in more
until the mould is quite full.</p>

<p>Now allow to stand for 12 or 18 hours, then remove the mould from the
block, the socket from the top of the mould, then gently push the roller out.
If due precautions have been taken, it ought to come out quite smooth. If
it does not, the composition must be melted off in hot water, and the roller
recast.</p>

<p>Composition for the clearing roller—Scotch glue, 1 pound; gelatine, 2
pounds; green treacle,
<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#8260;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>
pound; castor oil, 2 ounces; glycerine, 1 ounce.</p>

<p>The glue and gelatine are soaked as before, then melted and mixed with the
other ingredients. The stock (covered with India-rubber sponge) is placed
inside the greased mould, and the roller cast exactly as before.</p>

<p>The rollers being pushed out of the mould, trim the ends square with the
ends of the stock, then dip the ends of each roller in hot water placed in a
saucer to a depth of half an inch, until the composition is slightly softened.
In this condition the sharp edges are rounded off with a damp cloth wound
round the fingers.</p>

<p>The object of thus rounding the edges is to prevent the roller marking the
picture when rolling up the image.</p>

<p>These rollers are not fit for use directly after casting, but should be placed
on the handles, and washed with turpentine on a slab, then allowed to hang for
two or three days, and occasionally washed over with a rag dipped in alcohol.</p>

<p>When in use the inking roller should never be washed, but if the ink upon
it requires cleaning off, it should be done by rolling it upon a clean piece of
hard paper. When put away after a job, the roller should be coated with fatty
ink. Clear it for work next time by rolling it on the paper.</p>

<p>The clearing roller will require keeping free from a superfluity of ink by
washing.</p>

<p>Instead of making the roller composition, and casting rollers, some of the
high class composition sold for type printing may be used, or the rollers may
be obtained ready cast, which will, perhaps, be found far more economical in
the long run.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Preparation And Care Of The Rollers.">PREPARATION AND CARE OF THE ROLLERS.</h4>

<p>Leather rollers when new should first of all be warmed in front of a brisk
fire, and when warm rubbed with a piece of Russian tallow until the leather
will not absorb any more. Then allow the roller to stand twelve
hours <span class="xxpn" id="p155">{155}</span>
and repeat the operation; then take some middle varnish, smear some of it
along the roller, and on a clean slab roll vigorously, and repeat the operation
two or three times, scrape the roller with the grain, then roll up in varnish,
allow to stand all night, scrape again, roll up again next day, scrape, then roll
up with collotype ink, scrape and roll up, repeating this until the roller takes
the ink evenly. After each time of using, scrape the roller before putting
away, and if, after using, the roller is likely to be some time before being
wanted again, after scraping smear it with Russian tallow, and wrap it up in
paper, scraping it before rolling it up in the ink again.</p></div>

<p>Glue rollers should be hung up after use in a cold place, and before being
put away should be coated with fatty ink, and just before using should be
rolled clean upon a piece of rather fluffy paper; washing glue rollers in
turpentine is not to be recommended, as it tends to harden them, and deprives
them of their feeding quality. Glue rollers can be bought ready cast, and it is
advisable to so buy them; any dealer in typographic material will supply them
of a suitable quality, if the purpose for which they are required be stated at the
time of ordering. The “durable” composition being very good for collographic
printing, it may be purchased and used for the rollers, for printing from a
heliotype skin, instead of the mixture given previously. For roller No. 2,
add two ounces of gelatine previously soaked in cold water, and as much water
squeezed out as is possible, then add this to the “durable” composition, and
stir until the gelatine is melted and well incorporated with the composition.</p>

<p>These rollers may be cast upon the bare stock, without the India-rubber
sponge, if preferred, but the India-rubber sponge makes the roller much lighter
for use, which is a great consideration when long numbers are printed straight
away.</p>

<p>These remarks are applicable to the rollers used in the work described in the
previous chapters. Too much care cannot be given to the rollers. The skilled
printer who has feeling for his work will soon learn to regard his rollers as the
magic wands which produce his results. And well he may.</p>

<p>The ink used for heliotype printing is the best chalk ink as purchased in
tins, brought to working consistency by mixing with lard, the two ingredients
being well mulled on the slab. Varnish must not be used, lard being the best.
Cocoanut and olive oil are also good. <span class="xxpn" id="p156">{156}</span></p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Heliotype Skin">HELIOTYPE SKIN</h4>

<p>is composed of a mixture of gelatine, glycerine, chrome alum, bichromate of
potash, and water, dried upon a slab of thick plate glass. The surface of the
plate glass must be very finely ground with emery powder (great care being
taken that there are no scratches or holes, or they will spoil the skin), then
thoroughly cleaned, and waxed with a solution of beeswax in benzole, a good
plan being to first of all smear the glass with the wax, and then polish as much
off as possible with an old linen duster (clean), then sprinkle with clean benzole,
and with a fresh duster polish the plate thoroughly, noting well that wax
marks will spoil the skin.</p></div>

<p>This waxing need not be done every time a skin is made, but at intervals of
every three or four skins.</p>

<p>The waxed glass requires levelling, so that the gelatinous mixture will set of
an even thickness; therefore, a levelling stand must be provided, as well as a
good and true spirit level.</p>

<p>The gelatinous mixture is dried in an oven (see Drying Oven in chapter on
Collotype), at a temperature not exceeding 80°&nbsp;F., the time occupied being
from thirty to forty hours.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="The Pewter Plate.">THE PEWTER PLATE.</h4>

<p>The skin after exposure to light under the negative, etc., is mounted by
means of a squeegee upon a plate of pewter 21 by 15 by
<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#8260;&#xfeff;<sub>8</sub>
of an inch in thickness,
and well polished. This plate is cleaned with benzole and coated with a
solution of India-rubber in benzole (well filtered) and dried.</p></div>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="The Mask.">THE MASK.</h4>

<p>To prevent the margin of paper upon which the ink picture is printed, being
dirtied, it is necessary, after rolling up, to lay a mask over the skin, this mask
having an opening in the centre the size of the picture. Paper suitable for
this purpose is made by coating bank-post paper with a mixture of one part
of gold size, and two parts boiled oil; this mixture is laid on the paper evenly
with a sponge, then hung on a line to dry; when dry it is ready for use.</p></div>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="The Heliotype Skin.">THE HELIOTYPE SKIN.</h4>

<p>To prepare a skin 22 by 16, weigh out two ounces of a good gelatine, and
soak it in ten ounces of cold water until soft, then place it in the
porcelain <span class="xxpn" id="p157">{157}</span>
vessel of a “Bain Marie,” the outer vessel being duly provided with the
requisite quantity of cold water; now place it over the fire or Bunsen burner,
and stir until the gelatine is just melted, then add two drachms of glycerine;
stir well, so as to mix thoroughly, and raise the temperature to 125°&nbsp;F.; add
two ounces of solution No. 1, and two drachms of solution No. 2; stir well,
then remove from the fire or Bunsen, and strain through muslin into a jug or
beaker; now tie over the jug or beaker a clean piece of muslin, when the mixture
is ready for pouring upon the ground side of thick plate glass, waxed,
properly levelled, and slightly warmed. Begin by pouring in the centre of the
plate, and gradually enlarge the circle until all the gelatinous mixture is out of
the jug or beaker, then with a strip of clean card coax
the gelatine to the edges.</p></div>

<p>Now examine the film for air bubbles, which, if present, must be removed,
either by pricking with a quill toothpick, or by coaxing to the edge with a
piece of card.</p>

<p>As soon as the mixture has thoroughly set (which it soon does), remove it
to the drying box.</p>

<p>Of course, the requisite quantity of gelatine for more than one skin may be
melted at once, but it will be better only to strain into the pourer, from the
“Bain Marie,” sufficient for one plate at a time, remembering that the quantity
now given is for one plate only; therefore, if two, three, four, or more plates
are to be dried at once, the quantities given above must be increased accordingly.</p>

<p>The stock solutions named above are compounded as follows:</p>

</div>

<p>The temperature of the drying box must not exceed 80°&nbsp;F., and the time
occupied will be from thirty to forty hours, during the whole of which time
the temperature must be steadily maintained, but not exceeded.</p>

<p>When the skin is dry, with the point of a penknife separate the edges from
the glass, and then lift the skin away, when it is ready for exposure to light
under the negative. If it is desired to keep the skins a few days before using,
they may be stored between sheets of dry brown paper in a drawer, or in a tin
tube. <span class="xxpn" id="p158">{158}</span></p>

<p>It will be just as well to remark here that the dry heliotype skins are sensitive
to light; therefore, the drying oven must be in a room illuminated by yellow
light, or by artificial light, and the skins must not be exposed to daylight until
they are in the printing frame.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Printing The Picture.">PRINTING THE PICTURE.</h4>

<p>The heliotype skin is now ready for exposure under the negative, which is
done in a printing frame 24 by 18 inches, provided with
a plate glass front.</p></div>

<p>The negative must be reversed (<i>i. e.</i>, instead of being taken direct in the
usual way, a reversing mirror is used). The margin of the negative must be
protected by a mask, with an opening cut the size and shape of the intended
picture, the outside edges of the mask being sufficient to cover the rest of the
skin.</p>

<p>To print, the back of the negative is cleaned, then laid with the film uppermost,
in the centre of the plate glass front of the printing frame; the mask is
then laid in position, the opening in the centre being adjusted so that exactly the
amount of picture required will be printed upon the skin. The rest of the
skin is protected from the action of light by the opaque margin of the mask.
Now lay the skin, with the matt surface (<i>i. e.</i>, the side that was in contact with
the ground side of the glass plate during the process of drying) next the film of
the negative; upon this lay a piece of dry black velvet, then a sheet of thick
felt, then the back of the printing frame, fasten up, turn it over and see that
the front of the glass is clean; then the frame is ready for exposure to light.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Exposure To Light">EXPOSURE TO LIGHT</h4>

<p class="pcontinue">should be made in a good diffused light, and its duration timed by means of
an actinometer (see page
<a href="#p107" title="go to p. 107">107</a>).</p></div>

<p>As the time of exposure to light will vary according to the quality of the
negative, no precise rule can be made, the best way being to get a small negative
as near the same density as the other, cut off a piece of the skin, and
placing it in a frame, expose to light at the same time as the big frame, and
occasionally examine the progress of the small strip of skin in the dark room.
A very good idea of the exposure of the big one can thus be had. A heliotype
skin is properly printed as soon as the details in the half-tones show themselves.
Of course, it should be understood that the small negative must be
exposed to light at the same time and place as the big
one. <span class="xxpn" id="p159">{159}</span></p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Sunning The Back Of The Skin.">SUNNING THE BACK OF THE SKIN.</h4>

<p>The exposure to light under the negative being completed, remove the skin
from the printing frame, and lay it with the side that has just been in contact
with the film of the negative, upon a piece of black velvet, covering the margin
of the skin outside the picture with strips of brown paper—these strips not quite
touching the picture; now cut off a strip of the skin, say a quarter inch wide
by one inch long, and double it lengthways, then cut a hole in a piece of brown
paper and place the doubled piece of skin under it. Now remove the skin to
diffused light, and as soon as the shape of the hole can be seen upon the undermost
half of the small strip, the sunning of the skin has gone far enough, and
it is ready for mounting upon the pewter plate.</p></div>

<p>The test here given for timing the sunning of the exposed skin is suitable,
when a good ordinary negative has been used, but if a negative somewhat flat,
or thin, has been used, then less sunning will be required, and if a very intense
negative, the time of sunning must be increased, the object of the sunning
being to reduce the relief caused by deep shadows.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Mounting On The Pewter Plate.">MOUNTING ON THE PEWTER PLATE.</h4>

<p>The pewter plate upon which the exposed and sunned heliotype skin is
mounted for printing from, must be well polished, free from scratches or other
marks, the size being 21 by 15 by
<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#8260;&#xfeff;<sub>8</sub>
of an inch in thickness. This plate is
polished with a soft duster, then coated with a solution of India-rubber in
benzole (about the consistency of sweet oil), the solution being poured on, and
flowed to the corners and edges; then the plate is placed upon a levelling stand,
and the India-rubber allowed to dry.</p></div>

<p>This India-rubber solution is made by dissolving India-rubber solution, as
sold in tins at any India-rubber warehouse, in benzole or benzoline.</p>

<p>When the solution is made it must be filtered through paper, or strained
through five or six thicknesses of fine muslin, as the presence of any grit between
the surface of the pewter and the skin would at once ruin the picture.</p>

<p>The India-rubber film being dry, place the pewter plate in a tray of clean
water, the water being about a quarter of an inch deep; now trim the skin
with a sharp pair of scissors to a little smaller than the pewter
(20&#x202f;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#8260;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub> by
14&#x202f;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#8260;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>&#xfeff;)&#xfeff;,
then lay the skin, face up, upon the surface of water, and at once lift the
pewter plate from the water, keeping the skin in position by grasping the two
top corners with the two forefingers. Now lay the pewter on the bench,
and <span class="xxpn" id="p160">{160}</span>
with a nice, soft squeegee bring the skin into contact with the India-rubber film.
This mounting must be done rapidly, as if the skin gets a chance of absorbing
water it will frill, and be spoilt. The back merely requires moistening, and
the squeegee, in expelling the water, brings it into contact with the India-rubber
film. Now, with the squeegee, remove all the water from the plate, and then
brush round the edges with some India-rubber solution, so as to reduce the
chance of water, to be used subsequently, from getting under the skin.</p>

<div class="keeptogether">
<h4 title="Printing From The Skin.">PRINTING FROM THE SKIN.</h4>

<p>Now place the pewter on the bed of the press, and with a clean sponge cover
the picture with clean, cold water, in sufficient quantity to form a pool about
one-eighth of an inch deep, care being taken that the water does not extend as
far as the edges of the skin.</p></div>

<p>The water is allowed to remain on the skin for five minutes; it is then
soaked up, and a fresh supply added, and this operation is repeated at intervals
for twenty or thirty minutes, the object being to partly remove the bichromate,
and also to allow the gelatine that has not been rendered insoluble by the action
of light, to absorb sufficient water to enable it to repel the ink from the roller.</p>

<p>When it is judged that the image has been sufficiently soaked, with the
sponge remove as much water as possible, then lay a clean sheet of paper upon
the skin; upon the paper lay the loose blanket, lower the tympan, run the bed
of the press under the platen, then pull over the lever, and subject to as much
pressure as the press will give, allowing the pressure to “dwell” for a minute
or two.</p>

<p>This is to “smash” down the highest relief in the skin, which, unless so
smashed down, would interfere with the roller feeding the ink in the deepest
shadows.</p>

<p>The skin is now ready for inking up with No. 1 roller, charged with the
best litho. ink mixed with a little lard, just sufficient, and no more, to make
the stiff ink distribute on the slab, the ink and the lard being thoroughly incorporated,
either with a stiff palette knife or with a muller. The ink and lard
being thus well mixed upon the slab, gather up the compound and place it in
one corner of the slab.</p>

<p>For No. 2 roller take a portion of the above mixture and add to it a little
more lard, and mix well, then place this in one corner of the other inking slab.</p>

<p>With the palette knife touch the roller No. 1 at short intervals with little
dabs of the first ink, then roll it vigorously on the slab up and down, and
then <span class="xxpn" id="p161">{161}</span>
across and sideways, until the ink is evenly distributed over the roller and the
slab; now with the roller proceed to ink up the image. Use plenty of pressure,
and turn the roller first one way, then the other, until the image shows itself
vigorous and strong.</p>

<p>Now take No. 2 roller charged (in the same way as No. 1) with No. 2 ink
well distributed (but do not use quite so much as with No. 1), and with a light
pressure go over the inked image; this inking will fill up the light half-tones
and clean up the image generally.</p>

<p>Before pulling an impression take a sheet of mask paper (which must be a
little larger than the pewter plate), and in the centre cut a clean, sharp opening
the size the picture must be. This mask, with the oiled side down, is adjusted
in position on the skin; then turn back the edge furthest from the operator,
and upon the extreme edge of the pewter place a few small dabs of stiff ink,
return the margin of the mask over these dabs of ink, and rub down; these
dabs of ink serve to keep the mask in position, when turned back for each
inking up. If the margin of the mask paper projects over the pewter plate,
and outside the bed of the press, it must be turned down, else it will tear when
the bed of the press is run in.</p>

<p>The mask being laid in position to protect the margin of the print, lay a
piece of matt enamel paper on the inked up and masked image, back this first
with a sheet or two of clean blotting paper, then with a loose blanket; lower the
tympan, and run the bed of the press under the platen and pull over the lever.
The pressure requisite to pull an impression from a heliotype skin requires the
full strength of an ordinary man to pull over the lever.</p>

<p>Now examine the print, and if it is flat and dirty, the skin has not been
soaked sufficiently before inking up, so remove the ink left by the paper by
washing it over with a rag soaked in turpentine, then wash with a wet sponge,
blot off the surplus and with the sponge again put a pool of water over the
image, and allow it to soak for about five minutes; again wipe it off with a
sponge, smash down and ink up again.</p>

<p>If the image is black and white without half-tones, the fault may lie in the
negative, which perhaps is too hard; or if that is all right, then the skin has
not been sufficiently exposed in the printing frame, in which case it may be at
once thrown away, as no amount of coaxing will make it yield a good print.
Or it may be that the skin is too damp, in which case rub it gently with the
water sponge, on which a few drops of alcohol have been sprinkled; then blot
off, ink up again, and pull another
proof. <span class="xxpn" id="p162">{162}</span></p>

<p>If the back of the skin is “sunned” too much, the print will suffer by being
dirty and flat, and will require sponging over with a little of the ten per cent.
mixture of ammonia in water; then blot off, and again ink up; take care and
keep the ammonia sponges away from the other sponges.</p>

<p>If the deep shadows show a white margin and are difficult to ink up, the skin
has been exposed under the negative for too long a time; and if “smashing”
down does not remedy the defect, the only chance of saving it will be to allow
the skin to get thoroughly dry, and then (say the next day) to soak it up again
for an hour.</p>

<p>Spots on the margin of the print may be removed by carefully painting them
over with a camel’s-hair brush charged with dilute cyanide of potassium, carefully
washing afterward to prevent spreading.</p>

<p>Each time the image is inked up, the mask must be laid back, so as not to
interfere with the roller; then after inking up, it is again laid in position, so
as to protect the margin of the paper upon which the print is made.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that the first print from the skin will not be the
best it is capable of giving, therefore, before any of the above-named dodges are
resorted to, the image should be inked up and proofs pulled four or five times;
as a generul rule perfection will not be attained until about ten or twelve prints
are made, using each time a good paper, as a soft spongy one will not pick up
the ink on the skin.</p>

<p>Of course, a plain black ink will not suit every class of subject, therefore,
when the operator requires a different tint or color, it must be made by a judicious
blending of stiff ink of the proper colors mixed with lard as given above.
When a distinct change of color is required, it is not a good plan to wash No.
1 roller, but have a separate No. 1 roller for each color. No. 2 roller may be
washed for such a purpose.</p>

<p>If it is desired to print two tints, the darkest tint is applied with the No. 1
roller, the lightest with the No. 2
roller.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="p163"
 title="Chapter III. the Collotype Process.">
CHAPTER III. <span class="blksmaller">
THE COLLOTYPE PROCESS.</span></h3></div>

<p>This process, roughly described, consists in carefully grinding with fine
emery, a plate of thick glass, then coating it with a mixture of white of egg, or
of stale beer and silicate of soda. After the plate is dried it is rinsed in water,
and dried again, then warmed, and coated with a thin film of bichromated
gelatine. This coating is then dried in a suitable oven, after which the plate
is exposed to light under a reversed negative, followed by a short exposure of
the back of the film to light, then washed in cold water until the whole of the
bichromate is removed from the film, when the plate is allowed to dry. It is
next soaked in cold water, then in a mixture of glycerine and water, after which
it is placed upon the press, and the printing proceeded with.</p>

<p>As in lithographic printing, the size of the paper upon which the picture is
printed determines the size of the stone upon which the transfer is made, so as to
give a good margin, not only large enough to prevent the paper being marked
by the edge of the stone, but also to allow plenty of room for working the roller;
so in collographic printing, the glass plate upon which the picture is to be made
must be sufficiently large to allow a margin of <i>at least</i> four inches all round the
outside of the picture. This is not only requisite for the reasons that hold good
in litho. printing, but for the additional one of giving plenty of room for the
manipulation of the mask used to protect the margin of the print.</p>

<p>Collographic plates should also be sufficiently large to prevent their edges
from cutting the composition rollers used for inking the image; for instance,
a roller nine inches long should never be used upon a plate less than twelve
inches wide.</p>

<p>Collographic films are made upon good patent plate-glass half an inch thick,
free from scratches, with the edges nicely bevelled to avoid cutting the rollers;
this bevelling the plates is absolutely necessary for use upon the machine, but
is not so important for the hand press.</p>

<p>To prepare plates for use they are first ground with fine emery powder. To
do this place one plate upon a smooth board or a couple of bearers across the
sink, sprinkle with fine emery powder (sifted through book muslin), then
with <span class="xxpn" id="p164">{164}</span>
water. Now, with another plate on the top, proceed to grind with a circular
motion, continuing the grinding until the emery is worn smooth; then renew
the supply of emery, sprinkle with water and again grind until the emery is
smooth; now work well with water, squeegee dry, and examine the surface;
if it is evenly ground the plates are ready for the next stage. If they are not
ground all over, cover them again with emery and water, and continue to grind
until the surfaces are of an even matt all over.</p>

<p>The plates being ground, they are well rinsed under the tap, and both sides
are well rubbed with a rag to free them from all particles of grit, etc., then
flood them with a mixture of</p>

<p class="pcontinue">made up an hour or two before using, and filtered.</p>

<p>The wet plate is covered with this two or three times, and then placed on a
rack to dry. When all the plates in the batch are coated the rack should be
removed to the drying oven and the plates dried <i>in sitû</i>, not lying down.</p>

<p>Be as careful as possible to prevent any of the beer and silicate mixture from
getting on the back of the plate, as it interferes with the running of the image
afterward.</p>

<p>Plates may be prepared with the preliminary coating in quantity, as the
coating hardens and improves by being kept.</p>

<p>When the coating on the plates is quite dry rinse them under the tap and
again dry them, this time quite spontaneously. Lastly, they are placed upon
the slab of the drying oven to get sufficiently warm before being coated with
the sensitive mixture.</p>

<p>The sensitive mixture must be made exactly as follows, as everything depends
upon the time and temperatures named: First of all, take thirty ounces of pure
water and add ten drops of a saturated solution of chrome alum; shake up well
and allow to stand ten minutes; if the water is very slightly opalescent, it
is <span class="xxpn" id="p165">{165}</span>
quite satisfactory, but if there is any tinge of green then too much chrome
alum has been used, and it must be thrown away and another lot made.</p>

<p>Then add two and one-half ounces of fine gelatine and allow it to soak until
soft, then place it in the “Baine Maire” and melt the gelatine, stirring all the
time. Raise the temperature to 125°&nbsp;F. and keep it thus for fifteen minutes;
next add 150 grains of bichromate of potassium in fine powder, stirring until
dissolved, and raise the temperature to 150°&nbsp;F. Strain the mixture through
muslin into a porcelain jar and allow it to cool, keeping it in jelly at least
twelve hours before using it.</p>

<p>This sensitive mixture does not work well if used to coat plates with directly
it is made; therefore, it must be made up some time in advance. It keeps
well, in fact improves, with keeping, up to about seven days. In remelting for
use, only melt just sufficient for the plates to be coated, as it does not improve
it to melt it too often.</p>

<p>Plates coated with the above mixture are dried at a temperature of from
100° to 120°&nbsp;F. in from two hours to three hours, and have a splendid grain.</p>

<p>Here is another formula the mixture from which does not keep, but must be
made and used directly. It is the formula most frequently used by the writer.
Plates prepared with it can be dried, at lower temperatures, in from twenty to
fifty minutes. It is also the best formula when copper plates are used instead
of glass, of which mention will be made at the end of the chapter.</p>

<p>Soak two and one-half ounces of gelatine in fifteen ounces of water until
quite soft, then place all in the “Baine Maire” and melt at as low a temperature
as possible; when melted add 100 grains of bichromate of potash and 50
grains of bichromate of ammonia both in fine powder, stirring until dissolved;
now put in the thermometer, and raise the temperature to 140°&nbsp;F. and keep it
there for ten minutes; then allow to cool to 125°&nbsp;F. and add the following
mixture, stirring vigorously the while: fifteen ounces of alcohol and five ounces
of a saturated solution of borax in alcohol. Mix the two before pouring them
into the hot gelatine. With some gelatines the addition of this mixture will
cause a slight coagulation of the gelatine, and it will stick to the stirring rod;
therefore, the solution must be stirred until the coagulated gelatine is redissolved;
then strain it through muslin into the pourer and at once use it by
pouring it over the warm plates.</p>

<p>One of the best vessels to use as a pourer is an invalid’s cup with a spout
at the side.</p>

<p>The above quantity of mixture is sufficient for sixteen plates 16 × 13
inches; <span class="xxpn" id="p166">{166}</span>
therefore, if only four are to be coated, which is the quantity that the drying
oven to be described will take, the above quantities must be divided by four.</p>

<p>Now if the first formula be used, take sufficient of the jelly, melt it and
strain it through muslin; then take one of the plates from the drying oven—which
plate should be just warm enough to be comfortably held on the palm
of the hand—carefully brush it over with a dusting-brush, so as to remove any
particles of dust that may have adhered and balancing the plate on the palm of
the hand, pour over it sufficient of the warm gelatine to just cover it. A 16 × 13
plate will take a little less than two ounces of the gelatine mixture. Take care
not to spill any. Next place the plate upon the hot slab, and coat the rest in
the same way. When all are done close the door of the oven and do not open
it again until the plates are dry.</p>

<p>With the second formula the <i>modus operandi</i> is the same, except, of course,
that instead of melting the already made jelly, the mixture made as above
directed is used directly after mixing. The plates being dry they are ready
for exposure, which need not necessarily take place at once, as if stored away
in the dark and away from damp they will keep two or three weeks.</p>

<p>The exposure to light is made in a box-pattern frame, the negative having
a mask in front of it to protect the margin of the plate from the light.</p>

<p>The negative used must be reversed—<i>i. e.</i>, the image must be in its right
position on the negative when viewed through the film, not as ordinary negatives
are—through the glass; therefore, a mirror must be used in making the
negative, or a skin negative may be used; or, if neither is practicable, the
negative must be reproduced by one of the methods already given.</p>

<p>The exposure to light in the printing frame will vary according to the density
of the negative, and the strength of the light, and should be continued until
the image can be seen well defined upon the gelatine film when examined in
the dark-room, by opening one-half of the back of the frame.</p>

<p>The exposure being complete, lay the printing frame face down upon a table
in the light, remove the back and packing, and expose the back of the film to
the light for a short time, without in any way disturbing the position of the
collotype plate or the negative.</p>

<p>This exposure of the back of the image to the light has a twofold advantage,
one being that it helps to weld the sensitized gelatine film to the surface
of the plate, and so enables it to stand the wear and tear of printing; the
other, that it reduces the relief of the picture, and so gives the inking roller
a better chance of feeding the deep
shadows. <span class="xxpn" id="p167">{167}</span></p>

<p>The duration of the exposure of the back of the film to the light will vary
very much with the subject in hand; if it be one with slight contrasts, a much
shorter time will be required than where the picture contains a lot of very
heavy shadows.</p>

<p>The next step will be to remove the plate from the printing frame, and
immerse it in clean cold water for five or six hours, or for such a time as
suffices to remove the whole of the bichromate from the film. The plate is
then placed in the rack to dry spontaneously, and should be allowed to stand
for at least twelve hours afterward before printing from, so as to give the film
a proper chance to become thoroughly hard.</p>

<p>We now have a collotype plate which has undergone the following operations,
viz.:</p>

<p>A plate of thick glass ground with fine emery until of
an even matt surface. Then it is washed and coated with the
pre­lim­i­nary coating of beer and sil­i­cate of soda and dried.
Then rinsed in cold water and again dried. Next placed on
the warm slab of the drying oven until just warm enough to
hold on the palm of hand. Then coated with the sens­i­tive
mix­ture, either No. 1 or No. 2, and placed in the oven until
dried. Then ex­posed to the light under a re­versed neg­a­tive
in a print­ing frame until the de­tails of the image are well
out. Then the back of the plate is ex­posed to the light for
a short time. Then it is placed in clean cold water until
the bi­chro­mate is removed. At last the plate is dried, after
which it is ready for the printer.</p>

<p>Now, before pro­ceed­ing furth­er, it will be as well to
touch upon various points of pro­ce­dure, and also to des­cribe
what may be reck­oned the most im­port­ant piece of a col­lo­type
plant, viz., the drying oven. Figure 17 gives a drawing
of the oven as it stands on the table for use, the <span
class="xxpn" id="p168">{168}</span> dimensions being from
the top to the bottom of the frame 5 feet by 3 feet 4 inches
wide by 3 feet deep. The top A, and the back, are covered
with matched boards well seasoned; the sides and front, B,
B, B, B, are made of frames 2 inches by 1 inch, covered with
canvas sufficiently close to exclude light, but still open
enough to let out the heat slowly. The door C is also a frame
covered with canvas, 24 inches square, sliding upward in
grooves, and balanced by means of weights. D is the jacket
of iron upon which a copper tank rests, the jacket serving
to carry the tank and to protect the wood-work from the gas
flame used to warm the water in the tank. E is a sliding door
in the jacket for the purpose of lighting the gas burner.
F&nbsp;F are the projecting ends of a levelling arrangement
forming the base of the oven, these ends being fitted with
good, strong screws working upon iron plates let into the top
of a strong table upon which the oven is placed. The distance
between the two lower rails or styles is 6 inches, which is
also the height of the iron jacket. D&nbsp;G is a tube let
into the jacket to carry off the products of combustion from
the gas. H is a tube with a screw nozzle, for filling the
tank.</p>

<p>Figure 18 is the base of the oven, <i>A&nbsp;A&nbsp;A</i> being the three points where the
levelling screws are placed; this base is formed of good 4 by 3 inch quartering,
the other dimensions being as marked. This base stands on the table, the oven
on the top, without any fastenings. <span class="xxpn" id="p169">{169}</span></p>

<p>Figure 19, the jacket of sheet iron well wired, with a tube at one corner, for
carrying off the products of the combustion of the gas, and a hole at the other
corner to carry the projecting tube from the tank, by which it is filled.</p>

<p>Figure 20, the copper tank, the outside dimensions of which are 37 by 31
inches, the flange fitting on top of the jacket; the depth of the tank in the
centre is 3 inches; the inlet pipe is 1 inch bore, and 6 inches long, the bend
being taken high enough to be about 2 inches above the top of the tank.</p>

<p>The base is placed upon the table, then the iron jacket on the top of the
base; then the copper tank is fitted into the top of the jacket; upon the top of
the tank is placed a slab of marble or slate
37&#x202f;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#8260;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub> by
31&#x202f;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#8260;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>
inches, cemented by
means of plaster-of-Paris. The wooden top of the oven is fitted into position,
the canvas being nailed on last. But, before doing this, it will be as well to
fix the bearers as at C&nbsp;C&nbsp;C, Fig. 21, with corresponding ones on the other side,
so that slats may be placed across for the
purpose of holding heliotype plates, and for
drying transfer paper, etc. The interstices
between the edges of the slab and woodwork
should be made good, either by means of
wooden laths or cement.</p>

<div class="figright imwth08" id="fig21">

<div class="caption">Fig. 21.</div>
</div>

<p>The oven being erected, the first thing to
do will be to fill the copper tank with water;
then level the slab by means of the screws,
or if the bottom ends of the base are shod
with sheet iron, wedges may be used to level
with. The drying oven must be kept in a
room at a uniform temperature of about
60°&nbsp;F.</p>

<p>In using the oven after the plates are dry
(after rinsing), place a piece of clean, dry,
brown paper upon the slab, then place on this paper four plates 16 by 13
inches—which are the size and quantity for which the dimensions of the oven
have been calculated; then place a thermometer between the plates, and close
the oven. After the water has been brought to boil, the plates will be ready
for coating; but, if the thermometer registers over 120°, turn off the gas, coat
the plates, again close the door, and let the plates dry.</p>

<p>One of the first things the student must do is to familiarize himself with the
oven. Note the time taken to bring the water to boil; the temperature of
the <span class="xxpn" id="p170">{170}</span>
slab, and the time taken for the temperature to fall after turning off the gas.
A day spent at this will teach far more than it is possible to do by writing.</p>

<p>Do not try to improve the oven by having the door to open any other way
than by sliding. If made to open in or out, a draught of air is created which
will cause mischief. Petroleum, instead of gas, may be used for heating the
water.</p>

<p>Instead of using glass plates for carrying the collotype film, copper or brass
plates may be used. They should be grained with fine sifted graining sand
and a stone muller, then washed with plenty of fresh water, and coated with</p>

<p>Prepare the mixture three or four hours before using, and filter it carefully.
The subsequent operations are the same as with glass, except that the sunning
of the back of the film must be dispensed with, and the second formula for
the bichromated gelatine mixture must be used, as the first one gives too high
a relief for copper.</p>

<p>Plates that have been used are cleaned again for further trial, by immersing
them in a pickle of American potash or concentrated lye, then well washing,
regrinding, washing, and finally coating with the beer and water-glass substratum,
exactly as before mentioned.</p>

 title="Chapter IV. Printing from the Collotype Plate.">
CHAPTER IV. <span class="blksmaller">
PRINTING FROM THE COLLOTYPE PLATE.</span></h3></div>

<p>Collotype plates are usually printed from, upon a typographic press, but
the best press is one with a cylinder, like the lithographic machines. Such
presses give a more even pressure, and at the same time will enable more impressions
to be made in a given time.</p>

<p>In the chapter on heliotype printing, a description is given for preparing the
tympan for printing from the heliotype skin, and that description holds good
for collotype plates; but we shall require a slate slab, the full size of the bed of
the press, and a little under half an inch in thickness, upon which to fix the
collotype plate by means of plaster of Paris.</p>

<p>The press being ready, take the dried plate, and soak it for half an hour in
clean cold water. After that wipe it with a clean soft rag, and scrape any
gelatine from the back that may have found its way there; spread as evenly as
possible some fine plaster of Paris over the slate slab on the bed of the press,
then damp with sufficient water to make the plaster the consistency of cream,
and lay the damp collotype plate in the centre, and press it well down, working
it a little so as to get it level and well bedded in; allow the plaster to form a
ridge all round the edges outside the plate, levelling these ridges by running
the finger over the moist plaster, so that they do not project above the face of
the plate. Now cover the collotype plate with a mixture of</p>

<div class="tablebox"><div class="nowrap">

 <td class="tdleft padr">Glycerine</td>
 <td class="tdleft padr">&#8199;5</td>

</table></div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">Allow this fifteen minutes to permeate the film, taking care that it covers the
whole of the surface evenly.</p>

<p>Whilst the plate is thus soaking up, get the inking slab clean, and the two
rollers ready, viz.: An ordinary lithographic roller, for inking up the heavier
portion of the image, and a composition roller for inking the half-tones and
clearing the image; then mix the ink to the desired shade by taking some stiff
ink from the tin, and mixing to the proper consistency with a little olive oil.
The ink must not be made thin, but just sufficiently softened to work up
with <span class="xxpn" id="p172">{172}</span>
the palette knife. The ink used must be very finely ground by machinery
with a minimum of olive oil. This, in hand grinding, is difficult to do, and
the presence of too much varnish in the ink is prejudicial to the production of
bright collotype prints.</p>

<p>The ink being mixed, a little is taken up on the point of a palette knife and
smeared along the face of the leather roller and then worked vigorously upon
the inking slab, until the ink is thoroughly distributed upon both roller and
slab. Do not attempt to thin the ink so as to lessen the labor of distributing
the ink, as that will only render the collotype print flat and weak. The ink
must be stiff and spare. Now remove the soaking fluid with a very soft sponge,
and blot off with fine plate paper, then proceed to roll up with the leather roller,
until the image just shows nicely on the plate. Do not attempt to get it to
take sufficient ink to look black. Next take the composition roller, and a little
ink thinned with lard to about half the consistency of that used with the leather
roller, and touch it here and there with the palette knife holding this thinner
ink, and roll up on another slab until the ink on the slab and roller are quite
even; now apply the composition roller to the image inked up by the leather
roller, and roll with a light pressure and quick motion. This will complete
the inking up of the image. Now take a piece of the mask paper mentioned
for heliotype printing, and having cut out a suitable aperture, place it in position
upon the plate, then put a piece of paper in position upon the mask; upon
this paper fix a large sheet of smooth waste paper, then loose the blanket, lower
the tympan, run the bed of the press under the platen, and after adjusting the
pressure, pull over the lever, run out the bed, and examine the proof. From
that deduce whether the ink is too thin, or too thick, or not enough, or too
much. Damp with a sponge dipped in water, then blot off or remove the
surface water with a damp soft rag, then ink up again, and repeat until a suitable
print is the result.</p>

<p>Some collotype blocks require the ink far thinner than others, therefore it
will be the aim of the printer to try various degrees of ink with each plate until
the best result is attained. The best prints are got, as a rule, from a roller that
seems to have very little ink upon it, but the ink thoroughly well distributed
over both slab and roller.</p>

<p>To print from a collotype plate it is necessary that those portions of the film
which have not been exposed to the light—and from them in proportion as the
gradation of tone progresses to the shadows—must be charged with moisture to
enable them to resist the greasy ink; if plain water be used for this it
would <span class="xxpn" id="p173">{173}</span>
be troublesome to get sufficient in the film to resist the ink, and at the same time
enable the roller to feed the image without slipping. Therefore glycerine is
used, mixed with water, and with various hygroscopic substances, to which the
term “etching fluids” has been given. This term is a misnomer, and quite out
of place, “damping fluids” being the best.</p>

<p>In addition to the damping fluid previously given, a few others are here
appended, each having their advantages under certain conditions:</p>

used too often, will be very likely to destroy the image altogether.</p>

<p>During the printing from a collotype block, the number of impressions that
may be pulled without redamping, will vary very much with each block.
Sometimes as many as eight or ten may be pulled, but the average will not
exceed two. As soon as there is a tendency to flatness, take a sponge containing
a little of the damping fluid, and go over the film with it, then wipe it
off <span class="xxpn" id="p174">{174}</span>
with another sponge, or a piece of damp cloth (soft), then blot it off with a
piece of good blotting paper, and ink up again. In fact, as a rule, it is best to
damp for each print.</p>

<p>Good printing paper must be used for collotype prints, and for very fine
work a fine neat enamel paper will be best. Coarse hand-made papers, however
much admired, must soon break up the delicate image.</p>

<p>I will describe another drying oven, the heat­ing
ar­range­ment of which is the same as the other, but the
super­struc­ture is much smal­ler. It will re­quire more care
during the time the coated plates are drying to keep the
temp­er­a­ture down, but it has the ad­van­tage of al­lowing a
ther­mom­e­ter being in­serted in the lid in such a man­ner as to
allow the temp­er­a­ture of the in­ter­ior being seen at a glance.
Still another ad­van­tage is, it takes up much less room. It
measures inside 18 inches wide by 32 inches long, and 9
inches deep to the top of the slab. The thick­ness of the
slate slab and of the copper tank should be the same as in
the larger oven; the lid at the top should be made solid and
have an orifice in the centre through which the ther­mom­e­ter
is pushed. The sides of the oven should be covered with one
or two thick­nes­ses of good red flan­nel.</p>

<p>The only thing that calls for particular attention in these ovens is the copper
tank, which should (especially the top) be made of good, stout sheet copper,
otherwise the water on being heated has a tendency to make the copper bulge,
and elevate the slab. By that means the care which should be taken in levelling
the slab will be lost, as this elevation will put it all out. Before putting the
superstructure in position, the slab must be cemented to the top of the copper
tank by means of plaster-of-Paris; this is important, as a much more even
heat is thus obtained.</p>

<p>Now, whichever oven is decided upon, it must be erected in a room free from
draught, where it can be kept at a temperature of 70°&nbsp;F., as the quality of the
collotype plate is much influenced by the temperature of the room in which it
is prepared. So, too, is the oven in which it is dried, especially if below 60°,
for then it is very difficult to get good results, as the plate chills when taken
from the oven, and the film is almost sure to prove rotten during the
printing. <span class="xxpn" id="p175">{175}</span></p>

<p>In the summer time, if the room gets too hot, the gelatine solution is apt to
get frothy, and then dry hard and glossy, instead of with a nice half-mat
surface. It is then best to prepare the plates only in the early morning.</p>

<p>The temperature at which to dry the collotype plates will vary according to
the subject to be printed upon them, as some subjects will require a finer grain
than others. But a few intelligent experiments will soon enable the operator
to judge of the temperature required; 75°&nbsp;F. is the lowest, and 120°&nbsp;F. the
highest temperature giving good, bright blacks.</p>

<p>One of the great secrets in collotype is to give a double coating to the plate.
I find it really a great advantage so to do. I found this out quite by accident.
One day, when I went to use some plates, I found that they had not been
properly levelled, and that the coating was thin at one end, and thick at the
other. This happened to three out of a batch of four, the other one being all
right; so, in a fit of laziness, or hurry, or something, I decided on recoating
the three, and did so. When I came to print from the three twice coated and
the one once coated, I was agreeably surprised at the difference; the pictures
on those twice coated were much more vigorous. Since then I have tried the
experiment exactly, and always get the same uniformly excellent results. The
second coating is applied as soon as the first is dry; but this second coat cannot
be applied so well if the plate be held on the hand, therefore a levelling stand
should be used, and the gelatine poured on the centre and coated over the
surface by means of a glass rod.</p>

<p>The proper quantity of gelatine solution requisite for a plate 16 by 13 inches
is 2 ounces for each coat. Note well that all of it is left on the surface of the
plate, not some on the table.</p>

<p>When once the coated plates have been placed in the oven, and the lid is
closed down, they must not be disturbed until they are dry; this will be in two
or three hours, according to the thickness of the coating of gelatine. If
removed before they are dry, there is danger of marking the film.</p>

<p>After the second coating of gelatine is dried, the plate will be all the better
if kept a few hours before being printed upon, care being taken to store it in
the dark, or somewhere free from damp and gas fumes.</p>

<p>By the bye, the oven must be placed in a room illuminated by yellow
light—<i>i. e.</i>,
daylight filtered through yellow glass, cloth, or paper; or else the room
must be lighted by gas or oil light.</p>

<p>The negative to be printed from should have all the parts that are
intended <span class="xxpn" id="p176">{176}</span>
to be quite white in the finished print, stopped out with India ink or Gihon’s
opaque, and the limit of the picture should be masked by very thin tinfoil, cut
quite straight and gummed upon the film side of the negative. The rest of the
margin of the plate must be protected by a brown paper mask.</p>

<p>The best printing frames for collotype printing are of the box (or “deep”)
pattern, with plate glass fronts. They should be about two inches deep, and
the bars behind quite plain—<i>i. e.</i>, without either screws or springs. The back
board should also be dispensed with, the pressure being got by means of
wedges. The advantage of these frames is that the picture can be examined
without undoing the back, and without risk of shifting the plates.</p>

<p>After printing, the plate should be placed in a zinc vessel like a plate box
fitted with a siphon, so that the water can be kept constantly changed, until
the bichromate is removed; then the plate is drained, and, after being wiped
with a soft cloth, is put away to dry.</p>

<p>Now then, beginners, do not be in a hurry to try your first plate on the
press directly it is free from the bichromate, as no plate will give a good result
until it has been dried down. Before putting it on the press, soak it for half
an hour in water, then half an hour in glycerine and water in equal parts, and,
finally, wipe it, and proceed to ink up the press.</p>

<p>The safest plan is the one mentioned, viz., bedding up slate with plaster-of-Paris.
Another plan is to place on the iron bed of the press a piece of thin
felt, then a slab of glass, upon which are placed two thicknesses of wet blotting-paper;
upon these place the collotype plate (the back of which is free from any
gelatine that may have run over after coating); then, if a chase be placed on
the press, the plate may be blocked in position by means of a few pieces of
furniture tightened by means of quoins.</p>

<p>In the above only glass slabs are treated of; but brass plates, about one-eighth
of an inch thick, will be found safer, and more economical than glass,
and yield results just as good. They may be fixed upon a block of hard wood
by means of a screw (countersunk) at each corner. If an ordinary type press
is not at hand, brass plates may be printed from upon a litho. press.</p>

<p>Whether the plate will require damping each time will depend greatly upon
each individual plate and the subject. With some, damping must be done
each time; with others, once only for four, six, up to a dozen pulls; but, of
course, the temperature of the room in which the printing is conducted will be
an important factor in determining this point. When the print is flat, and the
whites degraded, then damp the plate before again inking
up. <span class="xxpn" id="p177">{177}</span></p>

<p>To insure even prints, care must be taken to keep the roller well charged
with ink. Much more could be written on this subject, but practice will be
the best guide.</p>

<p>A word as to bedding the glass slab on. With a properly prepared leather
litho. roller, charged with ink mixed with a little olive oil and varnish,
brought to a working consistency with a muller on a smooth slab (be sure
that the ink on the roller is evenly distributed), after wiping the plate carefully
with a soft, damp cloth, proceed to ink up the image slowly and carefully;
then, when all the ink possible has adhered to the image, take the glue roller
and apply it three or four times, which will clear the image wonderfully.
Now put the mask in position—either a cut-out, or four narrow strips of bank-post
coated with gold size and oil, and then dried—then put a piece of mat
enamel paper in position, then a piece of common printing paper on top, then
a piece of blanket; lower the tympan, run in the bed, and press, and, if the
pressure is not too much, the prints will be just as good; but, if too much
pressure be used, the paper will be creased and spoiled, and the collotype image
is in danger of being cut.</p>

CHAPTER V. <span class="blksmaller">
THE NEW HOME PRINTING PROCESS.</span></h3></div>

<p>There is a method of making reproductions from photographs without any
photographing process further than that required to supply the print. Any
good photograph with a matt surface may be traced over with the ink supplied
for the purpose by the inventor of the process, or with the ordinary lithographic
autographic ink, which comes in sticks like India-ink, and then the
superfluous portions faded away (or not) as directed on a preceding page. From
that or from a crayon sketch, music, a written letter, plans, or circulars, in fact,
from anything written with the proper ink with a pen or printed, reproductions
may be made. The principal appliances
needed are the “Universal Copying
Machine” and its accessories.</p>

<p>Where the results desired need not be of as high a grade
as those made by the Col­lo­type pro­ces­ses, or where there
is not time to make a zinc etching, this meth­od will serve
a good pur­pose and pro­duce sat­is­fac­tory re­sults. The zinc
plates used for etch­ing will serve to hold the trans­fers. The
meth­ods for clean­ing the plates, already given, will serve
here also. The ma­chine should be se­cure­ly fas­tened to a table
and <i>the bearings must be kept well oiled</i>.</p>

<p>Write, draw, or trace the original with a steel pen and the ink, on well
calendered paper, not too thick. For drawing, a fine pen is the best. Then lay
it, written side up, in a shallow dish, cover the paper with the transfer solution,
leave it from four to five minutes. If the writing is several days old,
leave it longer—about ten minutes. Lay it between blotting paper and dry
gently by rubbing with the hand or a cloth. Then lay it, written side down,
upon the polished plate, pass it from four to six times under the iron roller,
having first placed a pasteboard over it. To prevent slipping, it is well to
cover the original with a sheet of blotting paper before putting the
pasteboard <span class="xxpn" id="p179">{179}</span>
over it. If you are not sure your press is screwed up evenly, run the plate
through two or three times, then turn it end for end and pass it through as
many times the other way.</p>

<div class="imctr01">
<img src="images/i179fp.jpg" width="600" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Place upon the small distributing roller as much printer’s ink as will go
upon the point of a knife, then holding the handle with the left hand, press it
upon the inking roller, and turn the crank, moving the distributing roller
from side to side, until the ink is evenly distributed.</p>

<p>See that the rollers are an equal distance apart at each end, so as to print
evenly. The original is now carefully removed.</p>

<p>After washing the plate gently with a sponge and water and drying it, also
gently, with a clean cloth, rub the whole printed or written side of the plate,
by means of a cloth or sponge, with mixture No. 1, not pouring the mixture
directly upon the writing, but upon an unprinted place upon the surface and
rubbing over the whole plate. Wash off immediately with sponge and water,
and dry gently; then pour about twenty drops of No. 2 upon the plate, not
directly upon the print, and rub over the whole surface, so that there is a thin
coating of it over the whole surface. This prevents the ink from sticking to
the part of the plate not covered with writing or print. If there is too much,
the paper of the copies will be yellow, and the negative may be injured.</p>

<p>Now lay the plate upon the pasteboard and pass it under the inking roller
(the pressure does not need to be strong); it falls before the iron roller; place
a sheet of clean paper upon the negative, lay a pasteboard over it, and pass it
under the roller. For the first impression it is well to pass it under several
times, until the negative comes out clearly and distinctly. From time to time,
after every ten or twelve impressions, apply No. 2; if the paper used for
printing is very coarse or porous, it may be necessary to apply No. 2 oftener.</p>

<p>As soon as the impressions become faint, apply a little more ink in the
manner described. After applying fresh ink, apply No. 2. Only when too
much ink is put on or unevenly distributed, or when the plate is not covered
with the thin coating of No. 2, or not properly cleaned, can the negative or
plate become soiled. If this should happen from any of these causes, remove
the spots carefully by means of a cloth wet with preparation No. 2.</p>

<p>If the ink hardens on the rollers remove it with lye or washing soda.</p>

<p>If you wish to interrupt the work, the plate must be washed with a wet
sponge, to remove the preparation, and then dried with a cloth. On using
again, apply No. 2, as before. If the plate has not been used for several days,
apply both No. 1 and No. 2. Do not use woollen cloths.</p>

<p>The mixtures No. 1 and No. 2 are supplied with the
press. <span class="xxpn" id="p180">{180}</span></p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that photographs may be reproduced by many processes
and in quantities to accommodate all sorts of demands. As an averment of
what the future holds, our book is brought to a close by the following quotation
from a recent issue of a daily newspaper:</p>

<p>“Some time ago the <i>Evening Post</i> gave an account of a new process by which
books were being reproduced in this country directly from photographic plates,
and it was said that the field for such business would probably grow in proportion
to the ease and certainty with which this kind of work could be done.
Under this process the most important work issued so far has been seventeen
volumes of the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, this production being sold at half
the price asked for an American reprint already in the market, and at one-third
of the price of the imported book. In order to make this reproduction, the
sheets of the English volume are carefully photographed, and the glass negative
placed over a thick sheet of specially prepared gelatine and exposed to the
sun. Wherever the dark film upon the glass negative prevents the light from
reaching the surface of the gelatine, this substance remains insoluble in water.
Wherever the light penetrates, the gelatine undergoes a chemical change which
makes it soluble. After an exposure to the sun or electric light for some
minutes, the gelatine sheet is washed with water and the result is a plate in
relief, every black line upon the glass negative being in high relief, and everything
else washing away under the sponge.</p>

<p>“Until the last few years, it had been very difficult to get this relief sufficient
to print from, but by improvements in the process effected by a number
of different inventors, this result has been obtained. The gelatine sheet having
been hardened, an electrotype is made from it which is put into the printing
press. Owing to chance, the gelatine sheet itself was used one day for printing
from directly, and it was found that a larger number of good copies could be
made from the gelatine direct than from the hardest electrotype. The only
drawback to the use of the gelatine plate itself in the printing press is its
liability to crack, for no reason that has as yet been discovered. If some
way is found of making the gelatine plate durable, it would be used entirely
in place of an electrotype, as it costs almost nothing and can be made quicker
than an electrotype.”</p>

<p>The way has been “found” and zinc etching is doing the work.</p>

<p>Finally, the essays of John Burnet, “On the Education of the Eye,” “On
Composition,” and “On Light and Shade,” copies of which are hard to get for
$100, have recently been reproduced by one of the processes given in this book,
full size, and is sold at $4.00. There is a great future ahead
for all process work.</p>

THE Huber Rotary Zincographic Press.

This press was designed and is now in successful operation
for printing from zinc plates the kind of work hitherto
produced from stone in the lithographic press; and by reason
of its continuous rotation many more impressions per hour
can be produced than by the stone method. Colors are printed
by it in perfect register and with no loss of brilliancy or
change of the color. The advantages of the use of zinc plates
are fully set forth in our circular No. 1, “Zincography”
which will be mailed to lithographers on receipt of their
address.

To purchasers of the zincographic press, we give full
instructions in zincography, and the chemical nature of the
various preparations, etc., without extra charge.

CARBUTT’S DRY PLATES
FOR ALL KINDS OF
Photo-Mechanical Reproduction.

STRIPPING PLATES for Photo-Gelatine Printing, Sensitometer 22, kept in
stock, and made to order more or less sensitive when desired.

STRIPPING PLATES, giving great contrast, for the Zinc-Etching Process,
Sensitometer 14 to 16.

PROCESS PLATE B, 14 to 16, capable of giving clear glass lines and great
density in ground, for Photo-Engravers.

FOR COPYING COLORS

CARBUTT’S ORTHOCHROMATIC PLATES will be found the greatest improvement
in Dry Plate making. They are kept in stock of Normal Sensitometer 22, but
made to order more or less sensitive as may be required. They are used extensively
by F. E. Ives, Philadelphia, and the Photo-Gravure Co., New York.

“If I may venture the prediction, I think the history of photography for the next decade will
be the history of orthochromatic work. Surely next to the production of the colors themselves,
there is nothing to be desired so much as the rendering of the true values of these colors. I place
the orthochromatic negative as the highest point yet attained in negative making, and as constituting
the outcome to-day of that germ which was brought into being nearly one hundred years
ago.”—Extract from Ernest Edwards’ article on “The Art of Making Photo-Gravures.”

“With reference to the Orthochromatic Plates. The Photo-Gravure Co. is greatly pleased with
its success in the use of your plates of this description. They enable us to obtain results which
otherwise would be impossible, and to do work that otherwise we should have to decline, placing
a great power in the hands of an intelligent operator....”—Ernest Edwards, for Photo-Gravure
Co., Brooklyn, February 13, 1888.

THE AIR BRUSH.

(Illustration: Medals: American Institute 1884, Franklin
Institute 1885, Franklin Institute 1887.)

The Brush applies dilute liquid pigment by a jet of air. To
photographers producing large work, its use is especially
recommended in place of crayon, and for water colors.
With equal skill on the part of the artist, the work is
accomplished with far more elegance, and with wonderful
saving of time. The Brush will be sent upon trial.

The Air Brush has been found one of the most useful helpers
in Process Engraving that has ever been discovered. See
instructions given in this book.

COPIES PRINT, WRITING, TYPE-WRITING, WOOD-CUTS, LITHOGRAPHS,
CRAYON DRAWINGS, PRINTED OR WRITTEN MUSIC, ETC.

The original is written with our copying ink or with our
ribbon, and then, by a simple and sure process, transferred
to a plate, from which any number of copies can be taken.
Print is transferred to the plate without spoiling the
original, and then copied like writing.

A great number of copies can be made from one original. As
printer’s ink is used, all impressions are alike clear and
legible, and can be of any color desired.

The negitive can be kept for years, or it can be removed in a
minute, and the plate used over and over again.

This process has been awarded medals at recent exhibitions in
different European cities, and is patented in Great Britain,
Germany, France, Belgium and the United States.

It is simple, cleanly, not liable to get out of order; can be
used in any climate, and is not affected by the weather.

Its importance to men of business, teachers in day and Sunday
schools, photographers, musicians, and others, is obvious.

The samples sent out are printed by ourselves, and on the
Universal Copying Machine.

Price of machine with outfit, plate 9 × 13-1/2 inches,
legal-cap size, $20.00. Price, with process to copy print,
etc., $5.00 extra. Ribbons for different type-writers, $1.00
each.

Larger machines can be furnished, if desired; but this is a
very convenient size.

The Photo-Gravure Company

No 853 Broadway New York

SOME OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.

New York Evening Post.

“As a work of pure illustration it is unique.

“Unequalled by any similar collection produced on this
side of the Atlantic. For the Photo-Gravures not even this
qualification need be made.

“Several of these are gems of their kind, and will surprise
even photographers who are not fully conversant with the
recent advance in that branch of engraving, in which the
Photo Gravure Co. stands unsurpassed now, when it is a
question of dealing with negatives from nature.”

Philadelphia Sunday-School Times.

“The pictures like those of The Art Review, are the work
of the Photo-Gravure Company, which has here produced a
distinctly American art work unexcelled in the present
season.”

New York Mail and Express.

“Reproduced by the Photo-Gravure Company in a most admirable
manner. They are not to be described, however, for there is a
charm about them, interfused in their soft lights and tender
shadows, which evades words.”

Philadelphia Times.

“One of unusual beauty.

“The execution of nearly all of them is admirable.”

The Nation.

“Our publishers have hardly begun to realize the resources
which this process offers for the decoration of books, with a
very slight enhancement of the cost.”

New York Independent.

“These illustrations are reproduced in deliciously soft tones
by the Photo-Gravure Company, of New York.”

The Evening Transcript, Boston.

“A volume of unusual beauty.

“Most of the illustrations are perfect gems.”

The Public Ledger, Philadelphia.

“The result is an art production by chemical and mechanical
processes, that is in its way comparable to the best work
of the engraver or etcher. It is something far beyond the
ordinary work of the photographer, and may be considered the
highest development of his art.”

The New York Commercial.

“Admirably reproduced by Photo-Gravure.”

The Commercial Gazette.

“Here again, the advance of the American engraver’s art is
strikingly apparent.”

The Literary World.

“We wish always to be sparing in the use of superlatives,
and guarded in the use of strong language, and to preserve
carefully what reputation we have for a conservative and
temperate judgment; but restraint is hard to bear in speaking
out our minds about the work which, at the present writing,
lies open on the editorial table.

“The Photo-Gravures introduced here and there by way of
border decorations are exquisite, and the occasional
vignettes dropped upon the corner of a larger plate introduce
a charming irregularity and variety.”

The Susquehanna Evening Transcript.

“The illustrations are the finest we ever saw in a newspaper
supplement.”

TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE

<p>Original printed spelling and grammar are generally
retained, with a few exceptions noted below. A few missing
full stops were supplied silently. The original page numbers
are shown like this: {97}. The original pagination is screwy.
The Introduction is on pp. xv–xvi, and then the next page
is numbered 9. There are no pp. 1–8. Illustrations have
been moved from within paragraphs to between. Blank pages,
numbered or not, have been removed. Footnotes, all six, have
been moved from within paragraphs to between paragraphs.
Ditto marks have been removed, with text restructured as
necessary to retain the original meaning. Similarly, large
curly brackets used to tie together information on more
than one line of text have been removed. The original
Index employed white space to indicate words or phrases
to be regarded as repeated from the text line above. This
edition employs instead the Unicode character U2015 <span
class="smmaj">HORIZONTAL BAR</span> ―, one for each word to
be repeated. The cover image was prepared by editing an image
of the original cover, and is in the public domain.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
